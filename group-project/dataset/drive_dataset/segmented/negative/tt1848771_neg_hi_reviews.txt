 title was not apt....movie, its story, nd everything else was useless..don't go for it ..big bore
 things other then mentioned on the box
 propoganda to divide hindus
 the storyline - lost and never found
 aarakshan is not at all about aarakshan
 the film doesn't know what it wants to tell
 aarakshan- a failure
