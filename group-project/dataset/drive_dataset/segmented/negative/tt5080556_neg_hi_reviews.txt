 shankar could have invested this money in a vfx the park and retired with a lifelong income
 where do i even start with this train wreck? the effects n action r so lousy that u can't even call it a poor man's transformers.

 a basic analysis of this movie
 8.5?! seriously?!?!?!?!
 expensive junk
 vfx over story line. its way overdone!
 just computer graphics, no proper story line
 2.0 ~ 2 ratings. best video game from india so far.
 totally depressed..!
 no story, no screenplay, vfx only.
 not even anywhere near to expectation
 not upto the mark
 dissapointed with the story line
 average movie
 expected better
 aura ? seriously ?

 india's most costly cinematic crap!
 worst movie ..ever from sankar

 utter disappointment
 2 star for 2.0
 dissapointing story line
 headache
 not even a popcorn flick
 who is villian who is hero? what do we have to conclude? did shankar left for us?
 this sucked big time. i wish bollywood never tries to make a hollywood type action movie again.
 i want my money back!
 1 star for 3d, 1 star for vfx & 1 star for music.
