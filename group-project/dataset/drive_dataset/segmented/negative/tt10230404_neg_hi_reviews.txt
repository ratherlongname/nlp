 how can this be named as ghost stories
 what a big waste of time !!
 non-sense everywhere.
 yukk movie
 not horrible
 disappointing,waste of time
 karen's short film - utter trash
 fast forward the first 2 stories, enjoy the third one which is creepy, surreal, gory n well shot n finish off the last one with a pinch of salt.
 fast forward to 3rd story and save your time.........
 waste of everything!
 mediocre stories
 started my new year awfully
 indian horror movie status in india
 netflix india please improve your content
 3rd one is an only good film
 stupid stories by anurag kashyap and karan johar
 not as expected !!
 worst
 pretty forgettable; i wouldn't recommend.
 karan you were the worst of all !
 feels like waste of time and data
 should have been called 'creep stories'..... that too not the good ones...
 one-line review: ghost stories (3 stars)
 very bad
 poor show
 just go for 3rd story
 just for diwakar
 don't waste hope and time
 didn't meet expectations
 creepy stories instead of ghost stories
 yet another over hyped series which failed to impress
 something was missing
 unworthy of hype!!!
 chutiye h saale
 neither scary nor engaging
 review with spoilers
 could have been good
 poor writing and acting
 such waste of talents and time
 average fare
 ghost stories
 not ghost stories, only dibakar shines.
 not that much ghost in there
 no thrills...disappointing.
 dont waste your time
 don't waste your time
 title should have been "creepy-weird stories"
 teen tigada kaam bigada
 lousy
 a true and complete experience after watching ghost stories without spoilers
 4 for karan only
 safe to watch for a scaredy-cat
