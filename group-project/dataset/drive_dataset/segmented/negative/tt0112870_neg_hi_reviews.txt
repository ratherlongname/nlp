 terrible
 awful piece of trash
 one of the worst, most mindless movies i have ever seen
 awful movie ever
 suckiest movie of all times!!!!
 pathetic
 full of cliche
 overacting karne wale awards le jayenge
 nothing extraordinary
 just a depiction of a simple love story, overatted and illogical
 awful experience, waste of time
 uncanny resemblance to before sunrise
 beats 'romeo and juliet' in stupidity
 bad bad watch!
 the bible of creepiness.
 an typical average movie
