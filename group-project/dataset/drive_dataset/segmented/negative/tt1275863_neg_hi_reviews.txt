 love aaj kal-worst movie of the year
 deepika and saif.... they both suck in acting
 waste of your valuable time and money
 love aaj kal !!!! :)
 slow start, poor story and overall poor performance, but nice songs!
 not aaj kal - not ever!!
 this kind of love, better say never!
 all looks no material acting
 love, oh! no!
 imtiaz ali all the way
 avoid at all costs!
 slow, boring and pointless...
 weak screenplay, does not engage audience - avoid
