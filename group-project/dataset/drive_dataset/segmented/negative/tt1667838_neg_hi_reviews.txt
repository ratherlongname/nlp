 how can- i hate luv storys : cynical film review
 simply falls flat on face.. what was karan thinking while making this movie??
 i hate love stories... seriously.

 poor show!
 apart from the songs, this movie is trash.
 a youthful movie in looks but too old & dull in content.
 a bad execution of repetitive story.
