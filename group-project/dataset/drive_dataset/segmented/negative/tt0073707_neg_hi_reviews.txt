 this movie is not a masterpiece
 putrid
 woefully pathetic curry western
 whole movie is a copied
 ugh! the poor horses!
 not this westerner's cup of tea at all
 disappointing to the max **spoiler**
 boring and disappointment
 most overrated hindi film ever: pure plagiarism!
 what a let down.
 overhyped
 what??? am i missing something???
 entertaining, but flawed and far too long
 poor and inconsistent writing
