 f.a.l.t.u. is a faltu movie. its script is copied from hollywood movie accepted
 complaont regarding non availability of movie.
 its weak, amateurish and has too many songs but still i fully support its novel thought on the admission percentage criteria of colleges.
 directionless, pitch-imperfect ho-hum
 very bad movie...
 where were the cameos ?
