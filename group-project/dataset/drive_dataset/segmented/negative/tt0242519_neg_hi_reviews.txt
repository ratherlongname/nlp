 genuinely the worst film i have ever seen.
 the most stupid movie i've ever seen
 that's what i will be
 hot garbage
 "don't plan for expenditure before we get money."
 umm....was this supposed to be funny?
 perhaps the most overrated comedy of all time...
 nothing new
 i know it's a cult classic but i didn't like it
