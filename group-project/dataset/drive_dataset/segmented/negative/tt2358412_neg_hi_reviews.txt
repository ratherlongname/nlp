 david (tamil)
 easy pass
 such a waste of time
 may god help david
 a good movie with good lines............
 story of two people happening in two different eras sharing nothing in common except their names
 waste of acting talent. waste of my time.
 boring, no entertainment....
 a good one, david fails to beat the goliath though!
 two is not a treat
 review for tamil version
