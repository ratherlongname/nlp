 a b-grade porno hidden under the blanket of feminism
 very unexpected tasteless,no proud moments for women,no empowerment for common housewives or girls rights to education or their role in society.this movie is all about sex.
 most idiotic feminist labelled indian movie so far..
 this lipstick is definitely not branded!
 slow & tiring!
 simple emotions are presented in very complex way
