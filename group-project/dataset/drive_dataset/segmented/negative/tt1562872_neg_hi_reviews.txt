 nothing great
 can't compare with dch, fully time boring movie
 a travel channel flick
 overrated & hyped
 is this supposed to be life-changing?
 good....but could have been better
 cliché dung
 predictable, naive and boring.
 farhan akhtar is anti india
 rip off of several hollywood movies
 over-hyped movie
 cliché
 so-so drama, but a great step forward for bollywood
