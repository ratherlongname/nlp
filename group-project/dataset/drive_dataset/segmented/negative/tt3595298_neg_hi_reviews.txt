 review ----full of spoilers
 seriously?
 felt like i was watching an indian serial...terrible even for salman khan
 utter boring
 complete mess!
 copy cat ate a rat... sooraj r barjatya.. so badly copied this movie.. no originality
 worst acting
 poor acting ... poorer script!
 awful!!!!
 sexist lyrics but catchy tunes
 not again!!!
 copy cat ate a rat...
 not the sooraj barjatya type of movie we have come to love and cherish
 good music. awful story
 too boring
 horrible
 the prisoner of zenda with an indian touch
 a well picturize movie for no sense - such a non sense ( in other words )
 barjatya's labour of love!
 old wine in new bottle
 the movie is about how to waste our money and time in cinemas.
 garbage
 this time, it's boring also. and highly patriarchal. and lame.
 not entertaining and funny like i expected
 big mistake is what it is!
 prem ratan dhan payo is a big letdown with poor direction, wafer-thin plot and messy drama. if you are a die-hard fan of salman, watch it otherwise skip it
 unbalanced mixture of family emotions, action and thrill
 outdated star-movie
 not worth the wait......
 a total waste of time
 its a rotten fruit served on a gold plate with gold spoon.!!
 double salman but not double the fun!
 waste of time
 one of the worst movie in salman khan's career
 wasn't expecting such a weak and badly written film from the reputed makers.
