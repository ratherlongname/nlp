 lacking a sense of time
 worst movie
 time waste
 watch it only n strictly for randeep's acting, transformation n effort. otherwise a hyper-melodramatic piece of nonsense.
 whats wrong with bollywood?
 randeep hooda is the only thing worth watching in this aishwarya rai bachchan starrer
 a incredible story not told well enough...
