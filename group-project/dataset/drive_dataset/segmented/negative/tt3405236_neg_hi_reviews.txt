 illogical ending to a nice moviy
 senseless, unoriginal and underwhelming
 watch at your own risk
 inspired from a gujrat mafia,wrapped up in bollywood melodrama
 tried too hard that made it a garbage.
 wasted
 this movie is just well marketed
 awful
 just wasted time for this crap
 7.7 overall ratings... really????
 what a waste
 rubbish rubbish rubbish
 bad film
 hackneyed story of a moral misunderstood smuggler
 bad film
 disgrace to bollywood
 bollywood crap
 a pure waste of your time
 absolutely rubbish!!!
 raees - the senseless - for iq score 01.
 one of the worst movies ever. time stopped running
 mediocre plot
 not recommended ðŸ‘Ž
 flop show
 enough.
 yet another embarrassment to the credibility of bollywood on the world stage
 good actors, bad screenplay
 srk one army show
 srk's death knell
 a wasted potential
 only for srk fan
 worst movie in last few years
 bad flick!!!!
 highly disappointed
 old unsavory wine in broken bottle...
 what the f*Â©i< is this ?
 fails to live up to expectation
 watch only if you are hardcore srk fan. serious movie goers avoid
 not a big movie by srk
 nothing special, nothing never-seen-before !
 below average movie
 not worth cinema ticket price
 nawazuddin upstaged everyone and everything .....
 raees ends up as a film that is just about mediocre enough to pass off as "mainstream"
 what was it? raees or gunday with one hero instead of two.
 review â€“ raees (2017)..a puerile attempt in concocting a gangster-saga that must have looked amazing on paper! (2/5)
 disappointing theatre experience
 not a srk movie.
 shahrukh trying very hard
 the alcohol is of substandard quality. â™¦ grade d+
 srk hams nawaz shines as usual
 an average bollywood movie....
 one time watch movie
