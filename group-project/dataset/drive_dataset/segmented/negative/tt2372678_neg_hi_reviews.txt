 exaggerated stereotypes of culture differences
 stereotype all the way through!!
 simply awful .....
 vicky donor remake.
 too much explicit scenes for young kids/teens
 4 just for scenario
 trash movie
 creepy
 stereotypes, pro-south india
 lost opportunity-shows weak characters
 the movie is a full time waste!!!!
 arjun kapoor is a normal guy
 truth -- tragedy of indian culture but attraction lacks
