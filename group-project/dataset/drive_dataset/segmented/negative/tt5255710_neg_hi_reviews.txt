 terrible movie, terrible script, terrible acting.
 worst movie i've ever watched!!!
 don't go for the ratings!! those are fake ratings!!
 the worst movie i have ever seen!!!
 not a good one at all
 awful experience
 two stars only for mawra and harsh's acting
 a musical romance ruined by unconvincing characters and sloppy writing!!
 an overlong, dragging tragic story
 mawra hocane shows us how effervescence can light up the screen
