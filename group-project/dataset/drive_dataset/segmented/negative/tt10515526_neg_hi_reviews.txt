 it's nothing more than a gutter
 worst movie
 inspired from nepali movie jatra
 beware of fake ratings!
 few jokes here and there / 3 stars
 awesome non-nepo movie
 waste of time
 unnecessary dragging
 gone case
 very ordinary story with counted funny moments
 don't trust the reviews.
 boring
 not as funny as i thought it would be..
