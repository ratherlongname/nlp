 nothing original. heavily inspired by two hollywood flicks.
 ridiculous
 boring storyline and vulgar dialogs
 plagiarized, misogynistic snoozefest
 blair witch meets paranormal activity done badly with indian actors.
 ragini mms - movie review : watch the original 'paranormal activity' instead of this cheap imitation.
 ragini mms : scary yet forgettable
 worth watching a least once!
