 humpty sharma movie review
 old wine in a styrofoam cup
 the most ridiculous plot of 2014. â™¦ 27%
 it is a tired, hackneyed story with zero originality!
 same old love story
 in our great hindi films market, they keep on giving us the same old stuff repeatedly & we keep on turning them into hits like fools.
 well, why r kjo movies becoming so predictable nowadays?
 predictable, common, a bit clumsy but, can watch once
 melodrama, stupid cliches and some good things
 very mediocre
 short review
 so sad....so very pathetic!
