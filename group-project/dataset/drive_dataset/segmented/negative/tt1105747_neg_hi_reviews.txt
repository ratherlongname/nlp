 yuvvraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaj
 an other disaster from bollywood.
 this disastrous movie is a rip off of rainman!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 subhash ghai disappoints again.
 subhash ghai's ram lakhan gone wrong
 disappointing
 could've been so much better
 poor direction, bad script and ridiculous acting!
 yuvvraaj
 pathetic! avoid this film.
 subhash is not a 'yuvvraaj' in bollywood box-office
 has got its merits but misses to hit the right note.
 a musical pleasure but average movie
