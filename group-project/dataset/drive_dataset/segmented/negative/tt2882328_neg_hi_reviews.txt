 another angsty film by ak, with plot full of holes
 average while watching, but idiotically dark script when you really think about it
 really worst movie
 pointless movie
 anurag need psychiatrist (a.k. is really ugly)
 wasted my time!
 rubbish
 title is itself perfect for film
 waste of time
 a depressing movie
 they tried hard
 ugly movie review - 'less distressing...'
 too many loose ends and unanswered questions
