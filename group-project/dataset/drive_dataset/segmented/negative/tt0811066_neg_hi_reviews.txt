 worst gangster movie ever
 flop
 pointless gore
 don't let them shot down your weekend
 a well intentioned film, let down by the masala ingredients
 shooting down real cinema
 what a waste!
 b.s. that almost manages to be stylish...
 does not come close to the hype
 action movie?
 masala mafia and cowboy cops
