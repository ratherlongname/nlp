 rambir kapoor: the runt of rishi's litter.
 avoid...
 clearly must not watch !
 ayan mukherji and karan zohar need to swap credit.
 one time watch
 yeh jawaani is not deewani!
 ayan mukherjee's yeh jawaani hai deewani isn't an effort but an attempt at direction, a miserably lazy one that too. yeh jawaani hai puraani, bahut puraani.
 only meant for ranbir and deepika fans
 a very badly directed, and a poor screenplay.
 not for guys!
 too formulaic
 typical pakau bollywood movie.
 bollywood trash
 better to wait for its television premiere then to shell out money for buying the tickets!!
 very disappointing
 predictable and disappointing
 ordinary.
 nothing good apart from two songs
 old script, new touch...
