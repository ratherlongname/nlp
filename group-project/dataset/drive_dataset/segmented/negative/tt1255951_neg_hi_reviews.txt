 calling it a mess is like being too lenient
 de dana dan is boring
 a dead comedy followed by an overlong climax
 dreadful
 priyadarshan's last comedy film....
 a clumsy act of absurdities.
 priyadarshan is a one trick pony...
 you can count the funny scenes!! disappointment..
 the throbbing in your head that is 'de dana dan'
