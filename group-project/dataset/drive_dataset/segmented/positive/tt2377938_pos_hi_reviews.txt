 akshay fooled manoj and neeraj fooled the audience
 an opportunity for a potentially good movie is now wasted
 not the best,but good thriller with awesome climax
 despite getting bogged down by forgettable dance segments, a kitschy romantic subplot & a hollow first-half, special 26 gains momentum post-interval and wins big with climax
 good acting, but story could be better
 intentionally cheesy?
 better than one would expect from akshay kumar's films
 special 26 is a super-over-smart movie with traces of buffoonery!
 special 26
 a smart film that's well worth your time.
 average treat that could have been scripted better!
 not as good as expected
 good watch! 3.5 of 5 stars
 great comeback
 excellent. truly entertaining & gripping.
 a breath of fresh air from bollywood!
 excellent direction
 little less than being perfect
 a fine heist thriller which is enjoyable if you are willing to ignore its big open loopholes.
 'special 26' is not so special
 ???special chabbis???
