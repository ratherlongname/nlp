 only if the script could have been tighter....
 boring 1st half ðŸ™„ a bad version of 'raazi'
 lacks thrill...
 a grand salute to unknown hardcore patriots
 all john, but no john here
 they should've gone with a more tighter script.
 after a slow start, movie picks up
 great projection wth bad exicution.
 good but could have been better
 romeo akbar walter (raw) ----- hell hath no fury as a raw agent scorned
 very good slow-burn.
 could be little better
 kept me going
 frankly, better than an overrated raazi
 good movie
 jocker played by ja
 not bad quite entertaining
 raw is added another feather to cap for john abraham after rocky handsome and parmanu
 a simple yet intense spy movie!
 be patient with this film as the ending will make you feel that it is worth it.
 a good film which could have been better
 good film
 definitely a good watch
 excellent movie
 nice ,decent, patriotic novie
 the movie is a brave attempt, watch for the stunning climax
 yet another strong performance by john abraham
 john abraham
 not your typical bollywood movie
 ignore the negative reviews! amazing spy movie!
 a must watch. could have rated 9.
 thriller
 based on false facts
 a tough and gripping tale of espionage
 good movie!
 really good movie! can't understand why the negativity
 romeo to akbar to walter
 it was the motherland, which was his own mother. masterclass
 a movie which ignites the internal patriot
 too much promotion of islam rather than the event? anyway its a good movie
 plays to it's strength
 a must watch underrated movie
 watch the movie and judge for yourself
 don't listen to the biased negative reviews....watch this awesome espionage thriller and judge yourself!
 good movie don't believe the biased critics.
