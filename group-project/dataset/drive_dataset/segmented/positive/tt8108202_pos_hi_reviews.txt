 a good movie but could be better
 potential to go big!
 good story badly written
 not as good as i expected
 a good effort
 low on scare, but high on laughs, this urban legend supernatural satirical comedy certainly entertains
 a good horror-comedy, which could have been a lot better with a stricter editor.
 stree - fiction or real
 review by a student.
 it's not horror movie it's comedy movie
 "mard ko dard hoga"
 a good comedy but a bad horror
 is she just an illusion
 smart marketing and some lighthearted comedy. not a great movie overall
 not so scary not so funny
 could not understand the story
 remove the dancing and singing and you have a good movie.
