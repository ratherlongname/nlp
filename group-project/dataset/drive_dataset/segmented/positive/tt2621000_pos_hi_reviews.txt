 the plight of the poor and also of the indian judicial system is well encapsulated in a courtroom drama.
 an honest & well-intensioned film!
 watch it to witness a rare entertaining court room drama from hindi cinema.

 repentance & atonement r the way to redemption!
 jolly llb - movie review
 a rib-tickling comedy which is a satire on indian judiciary system
 its a "jolly" good movie
 we believe in-justice
 awesome movie.
 the grimy, greedy anti human rights outlook of many lawyers is exposed.
 saurabh shukla takes the cake.
 awesome film. was highly anticipating its sequel. all the zest fizzled after reading that arshad is not part of its sequel.
 its a thriller, so i want to pen down the loopholes
 far better than jllb 2
 what a comedy!
 highly recommended üëç
