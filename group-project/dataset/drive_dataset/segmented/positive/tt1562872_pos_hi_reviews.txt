 believe me its neither hangover nor dch. its "boring"
 heartwarming movie of a road-trip of self-discovery
 strictly for ultra rich people
 very shallow !
 simple safe journey flick
 the poetry stays
 a road trip film with the usual clich√©s...though it's still very well made and worth seeing.
 awesome movie
 superb fun
 no hay segunda oportunidad de vida
 life is only once
 vagabond of emotions;this road movie is a trip to remember
 with a well paced narrative and brilliant acting, one must confess that this was a joyful experience
 smart, spanish, and a surprisingly spiritual celebration of life!!
