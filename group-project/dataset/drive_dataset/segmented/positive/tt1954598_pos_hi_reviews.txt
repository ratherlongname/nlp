 a decent entertainer...
 a nutshell review: ladies vs ricky bahl
 first half impresses,..second half depresses
 entertaining but could've been better with a little different ending.
 not too bad but also not good enough
 one time watch on a really bad day
 a good movie
 good story with poor making
 good follow-up
 hilarious but an okay movie
 a well presented con story.....
 worth watching....so far the best movie this winter...
 excellent movie!
