 epic
 a waste of time
 detailed history of 3rd panipat battle
 6****** only for sanjay dutt, ashutosh sir's direction and bg score.
 not as bad as the trolls would like you to believe
 bad actors
 better than manikarnika
 a decent watchüëçüèª
 good but not very good
 the great betrayal is a lavishly mounted affair
 a bit inordinately long but sensible
 arjun kapoor dosen't suck in this
 great piece of work by mr. gowariker
 better than over-rated historical flicks
 panipat ... decent one time watch ... a tad bit long !!! #sanjuzzreviews
 to relook, recreate and remind
 not that worse as the reviews were
 its reasonably accurate, not bad at all
 marathi people will definitely like it.
 went with low expectations, came out pleasantly surprised...
 overall a good one
 6.4 star for manikarnika and 5.5 star for this really ??
 ok, but not so grand like jodhaa akbar
 better than expected
 authenticity turned into patriotic fiction
 history's biggest betrayal
 average
 not as bad as some are saying it is
 worth a watch
 interesting; never got bored
 excellent movie
 entertaining history lesson
 accurate and detailed
 the movie deserves better ratings and audience response
 panipat

 ashutosh govarikar you did it!!üëç marvellous!!

 apalling to see that the negative reviews are so biased

 very well oriented and direction
 don't fall for false propaganda against the movie.
 enjoyed the movie
