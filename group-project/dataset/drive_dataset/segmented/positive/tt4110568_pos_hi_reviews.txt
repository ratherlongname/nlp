 a potpourri of vestiges review: dil dhadakne do (2015): zoya akhtar's insipid family drama about a delhi-based upper class punjabi business family
 held my attention
 "a family entertainer straight from the heart"
 a well-attempted yet, not very impressive westernised take of an indian travel-themed-story
 dil dhadakne do conveys: love, live and let live.
 let the hearts beat.....loudly. speak up.
 a family drama....nothing more!
 one time watch
 a movie good in parts !!
 zoya akhtar's liberation of life manifesto is here; break the shackles with dil dhadakne do!
 dil dhadakne do: character-driven brilliance minus the cheese and corn

 all about life & love
 "dil dahdakne do" ("let the heart beat") is an ambitious and enjoyable indian film.
 must watch family melodrama.
 despite few hiccups, dil dhadakne do should be watched for brilliant and convincing performance
 the movie is flawed but sensible, practical and relevant and deserves a watch.
