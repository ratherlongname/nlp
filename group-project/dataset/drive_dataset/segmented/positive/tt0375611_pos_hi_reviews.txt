 fake. pretentious. designed for awards.
 by no means a masterpiece (spoilers)
 great design, weak story
 another hollywood copier
 nice story, mediocre acting, lousy character development
 good film but copied from hollywood (again)
 bhansali overreaches and comes up short...again
 decent
 knowledge is compassion,power and independence!
 i'm a robber not a killer
 a small yet definitely progressive step for indian cinema
 great idea.....idiotic execution
 excellent and stunning
 black's beautiful
 worthy effort, lacks credibility
 not bad for an indian movie
 i changed my views about hindi movies too...
 good movie and good acting!
 pretentious yet impressive; manipulative yet moving
 it's an excellent film but why does mr. sahai yell so often and talk so much?!
 a little hollow, nah?
 there was sholay then lagaan then everything went black
 black---- a color of ambition
 amazing....wot else can i say!!!
 from darkness to illumination...
 good storyline & as well as best direction.
 the voice of silent fingers: black
 unique vision from darkness to shadows
 a glimpse into the realities of life
 black magic...
 one of best bollywood films

 from darkness to light.....................
 hindi cinema at its best

 extremely moving and beautiful
 black is for light
 living life more vividly than we could ever imagine
 changed my opinion about rani mukherjee
 the best movie by bhansali
 an honest opinion of black
 beautiful - like a full moon with blemishes!
 black:-where actors excel
 amitabh has done it all.........
 possible spoilers...
 excellent movie
 decent
