 epic paranormal love story
 epic of love that travels in time
 enjoyable movie, despite what the wannabe siskel and eberts conclude
 looking for closure may leave you wanting.
 seven for underlying plot
 singularity or wholeness?
 again i ask myself a simple question
 the bad reviews for this movie are unfair
