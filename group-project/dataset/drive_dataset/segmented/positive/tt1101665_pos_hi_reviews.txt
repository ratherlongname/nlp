 a thoughtful, polished, inspired thriller about a court martial
 a few good men and kay kay
 strong story, failed narrative. â™¦ 61%
 definitely a copy.... but a good copy...
 a few good moments from a rip of a few good men
 fantastic!! i liked it!
 it was quintessential kk!
 nice movie to watch
 7.5/10 shaurya - worth a watch
