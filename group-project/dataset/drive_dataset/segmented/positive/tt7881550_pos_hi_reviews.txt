 sanjay mishra delivers a superlative performance
 not a die hard thing
 a great thought of concept!
 sweet movie, nice story
 a good movie
 life of (almost famous but not so famous) side actors of bollywood
 heartbreakingly modest.
 tribute to those who we don't know
 one of the best of 2020
 inspired from birdman
 "enjoying life aur option hi kiya hai"
 must watch for mishra ji fan

 amazing movie which shows the reality.

 versatile
 a story of an unrecognized performing artist and a portrayal of real vs reel life.
 a success in the storytelling
 angst and heartbreak to remain relevant
