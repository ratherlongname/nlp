 a classic rope a dope...!!
 bit quirky, but largely humdrum social drama / 6 stars
 great idea although contains loopholes
 enjoyable!!
 a good satire on society
 fulll marks for acting and direction, but story has diluted the concept which it was trying to highlight
 uneven storytelling and overlong narrative ruins another superb nawazuddin performance
 a fascinating satire on society
 a good satire on various social issues
 save nawaz sir
 good concept but bad execution
 it's a must watch, touching yet depressing and heart breaking at times.
 a dark satirical drama
 smart ones and slow ones
 bit slow and dragged somewhere but a very nice movie
 ok ok
 very different kind of movie
 chhota bacha jan ke........ (7* by debojyoti)

 movie good but too much absurd language
 recommended üëçüèº by hit ya flop - movie world
 chasing excellence in society
 it's engaging and sensational
 one of the finest films of 2020
 something different.
 very good narration of many social issues and the struggle of bpl people.
 unique concept movie.
 nawazuddin + netflix creating magic again...
 genius, manipulative, smooth, or plain fraud?

 interesting
 its a solid eight.

 direction of sudhir mishra and acting of nawaz duo rocks
 too good for primitive minds
 the very truth of our society
