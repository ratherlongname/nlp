 exorcism on a haunted ship
 script had many weaknesses
 a good but not great horror movie. - itsbymayank
 nothing horrible...
 good attempt
 average movie
 indian ghost ship
 not so horror
 bollywood struggling with horror genre
 a pretty decent effort, considering the usual bollywood standards in horror!
 doesn't steam

 medium level fear

 watchable, but not horror
 average movie
 kept me edgy
 way better than expected
 good movie but not fully horror
 one time watch
 above average
 good effort..
 better than the cliche india horrors
 for horror it is fine.
 not as bad as expected
 promising concept used well in the first half but clich√©d in the second
 good !!!
 above average bollywood horror.
 one time watch
 sea bird

 a good movie. nicely directed! good performance

 good story
 vicky kaushal tries hard to make the story work
 everything is here, but horror is not fair
 watchable and a very good effort üëçüëç
 a murder mystery with paranormal coincidences and amazing acting.
 horror-mystery with bit drama
 after a long time
 "horror at it best" üíÄ
 horror done right.
 an engaging horror movie....
 one of the better horror movies made in india - better than the reviews suggest here !!
