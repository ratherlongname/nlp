 decent action thriller.
 good story-line, wrong casting
 did not meet expectations
 passable action thriller / 6 stars
 an average movie with good performances
 a fine and decent emotional thriller.
 good first half followed by a weak second half
 on acting based amezing but from storyline it's average .1 time watch
 direction was too bad
 no doubt about acting but storyline is disappointing
 vidyut's journy to noman to find his wife.
 slow and slug second half seems disconnected
 mistaken for undercover agent
 vidyut show
 good one time watch.
 good story but could've been better
