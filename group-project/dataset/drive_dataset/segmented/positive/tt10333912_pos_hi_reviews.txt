 slow and uninteresting
 excellent acting shadowed by unnecessary slow pace.
 not very entertaining
 a tale of greed that could have been executed better.
 one time watch, just for ab, ak
 good movie !!!
 very very slow!
 boring
 wannabe khosla-ka-ghosla
 only a one-time watch movie.
 just a decent movie
 nice one time watcher...
 passable
 good acting, boring script
 how to ruin a potential classic
 too slow and little bit boring
 a bit slow and lot of boredom
 a confined and narrow topic gets a little funny treatment but couldn't fight it's own mess somehow.
 ending didn't make any sense
 comedy satire with few sparks
 it's like : watch till end
 bumpy ride
 simple time pass movie
 a different but forgettable experience.
 one time watch
 not the best work from shoojit sircar but some solid performances makes it a watch worthy movie especially stellar performance by mr. amitabh bachchan
 a good movie to watch at home.. keep ur expectations in check.
 shoojit sircar didn't disappoint.
 aao kabhi haveli pe
 amitabh bachchan steals the thunder, ayushmann khurrana is commendable in this light heart-ed comedy
 nicely picturised with impactful situation created.
 worth watching
 fatima begum and mirza are the soul of gulaabo sitabo
 i liked it but don't think everyone could
 ok..!
 ending is good but a little slow
 good attempt at a different genre
 good movie
 had to cut 3 star because of storyline and length
 not a regular bollywood movie
 melodrama with a top-notch performance
 acting was superb
 watch for acting of entire cast, with not much story-wise & a bit lengthy
 thug life climaxüòé
 fantastic storytelling with an unconvincing ending.
 delicate take on voracity
 simple, funny with a deep message.
 gs excels...
 it grows on you
 sweet and simple storyline
 simple yet touching
 this is indeed a beautiful film and a must watch. gulabo and sitabo is showing signs that satire is emerging as the new genre in the indian film industry.
 it's a very deep multi-layered film with lots to say...
 good content, articulated in a simple story which tells us a tale of a 'mahal' and its dwellers and their predicament.

 worth watching
 hilarious satire
 the film with cleanest message
 silent comedy.. love the duo
