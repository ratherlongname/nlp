 admirably ambitious though flawed.
 not that great... as expected!!
 disappointing...........
 good but leaves a lot to be desired
 nonsense
 as honest as i can make out of viswaroopam !!!!
 it is just an ordinary movies with good special effects.
 best indian spy thriller
 kh bangs on international platform and subject well except for 2nd half
 disappointing
 certain sections are good.
 waiting for the second part ....
 too much drag
 breath stacking action but nothing new in story
 a masterpiece before intermission and a let-down later with a shaky climax.
 a spy thriller film.
 viswaroopam : not great.. ok ok
 action – intellect – out of box – controversy – viswaroopam
 best in technical perfection and expected to be a turning point in indian filmaking.
 a well made film
 one time watch!
 yet another kamal dance classic ( first half only)
 its kamal's vishwaroopam as a genius literally!
 awesome technical brilliance!!
 perfect script , great acting but just not enough.....
