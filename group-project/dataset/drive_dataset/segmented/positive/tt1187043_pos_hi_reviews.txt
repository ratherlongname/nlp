 had potential but lacked execution
 engineering college redemption
 it is not a great movie, it is a good movie though
 good, not great
 clearly the best hindi movie of 2009.. must watch
 an average movie which still is better than most of the comedies which rolled out this year in bollywood (yes, that's the sorry state of bollywood these days!).
 the story deserved a better climax at the end.
 not original, nothing new.
 a different indian movie but a little dragged on
 3 idiots: chetan bhagat, raju hirani and us
 3 idiots
 not all is well.
 i don't get it
 one of bollywood's best. that isn't saying much.
 opinion
 funny movie!
 my take: at the least, you can't say you don't get a full-course meal of movies in one large one
 good movie but not as good as it is rated
 stupid entertainment movie
 overrated and laden with clich√©s
 way overrated
 this movie is an anomaly in the top 250 list
 all is well...?
 comedy movie with message
 am i missing something this movie is mediocre and waaayy to long
 great entertainer / but story and character holes
 good, but they overdid it.
 typical vidhu vino chopra type of comedy film
 a bollywood for everybody
 feel good
 good in comedy but somewhat below expectation!!!
 good, not outstanding
 overrated
 very funny and one of the best comedies i have ever seen !!
 all izz very very well :)
 a treat!
 all is well
 a good entertainer but over-hyped as usual
 3 idiots definitely tries to do things differently ... to certain extent successfully!
 good. but misses the bullseye !!!
 one of the better bollywood movies i saw
 a hilarious and very much bollywood conceptualization of 2 stories
 great entertainment...
 very joyful movie !
 the most meaningful goofy movie.
 buddhadeb maji
 another good venture from hirani
 genius idiots
 a satisfactory meal, but not the best...
 more than just a laugh...taught me great life lessons as well
 one time watchable
 funny*25000000
 all is kinda well for 3 idiots. it was mostly a great feel-good movie.
 different great movie
 another mix bag from bollywood, but we love it!
 3 idiots
 over-hyped movie. good fun for half the way
 a fresh coming of age tale with a big heart!

 for smiting those who are lame enough to give this movie a one or a two star rating
 my intro to bollywood: comedy, musical, melodrama in one
 reality of iit
 best movie to showcase thw mental pressure of a student

 it talks about faulty education system, unnecessary study pressure, wrong high expectation of parents, increasing materialism and ignorance of human values the funny way
