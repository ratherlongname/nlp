 reality cinema about an important history of indian politics with no commercial adulteration
 real story
 tight and gripping account on the sri lankan civil war and rajiv gandhi assassination.
 could have been much better
 one would like it if you been tortured by recent bollywood movies
 stereotypically modified-original story, standing on crooked roots. ‚ô¶ 55%
 acting and play out suffers
 100 for attempt. 50 for execution
 not must watch yet somewhat it is
 choose madras over chennai. it is crisp, clean and clear.
 well directed, well shot, but not well acted.
 riveting, exciting, watchable!
 startling and compelling.
 packs a punch!
 bold movie let down by the acting
 appreciative effort but not anything more..
 real content always wins! madras cafe is excellent.
 intense!
 a sensitive story was told in a fantastic way!
 if movies will be made like this in india, i'll stop watching hollywood
 it made me revisit vardi waala gunda on celluloid
 seriously good spy thriller
 courageous effort by john abraham
 well written ,well executed ,poorly acted..!
 madras cafe - a well shot, focused attempt to make a fine political thriller which strictly lacks a lot for the common man.
