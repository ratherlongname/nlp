 a beautiful film masquerading as an ordinary one
 full of clichÃ©s but the lead actress was good.
 average movie
 performances r good
 one time watchable movie.
 teacher overcomes prejudice for herself and her students
 front of the class - hichki
 people have been generous with this one
 tourette doesn't work but the film is warm
 are people really this ignorant about tourette syndrome?
 definitely an a+ for rani mukerji's performance but the lacks characterization
 good to watch if u can ignore the faults or don't see them.
 good concept
 hichki
 inspirational and emotional
 why is no one talking about this ?
