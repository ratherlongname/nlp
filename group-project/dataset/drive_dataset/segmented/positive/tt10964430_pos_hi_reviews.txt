 a ridiculous story with the most hollow central character
 women rights shown in an ethical manner
 the movie stopped right after one thappad
 lost in 2nd half
 taapsee is clap worthy, thappads not.
 good attempt, but couldn't portray the message properly.
 a good one but does not keep pace!
 fresh on the plate!
 watchable. great message.
 good social drama.
 it's a good movie but
 excruciatingly slow
 a very good movie and artists are good but over-reaction climax
 loved the concept !
 good but could have been better
 nice try, but could have been done better
 valuable lessons from #thappad
 movie highlights self respect for women
 the movie picks up the right questions , few actors could be better
 touches upon a very sensitive subject
 a good watch
 thappad ( a film related to self respect)
 a thought provoking family drama
 ending was panic

 sinha comes up with yet another relevant film; this time, a battle against misogyny! [+74%]
 thappad is mirror to all men, chapter for all women

 this movie is thappad on our patriarchal society
