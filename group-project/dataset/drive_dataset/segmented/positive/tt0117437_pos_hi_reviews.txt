 a pretty good bollywood entertainer, i don't understand the criticism
 a musical treat.
 loud and melodramatic
 shameless copy of pakistani film aina
 nice to watch
 romance with comedy
 my favorite masala film of all time...
 raja hindustani
 worth it for actors,dialogs and script
 raja.... a great film
 evergreen classic of bollywood
