 underrated movie
 abhimaan meets kramer vs. kramer, and somehow succeeds!
 rohit is a perfect example of selfishness
 a shameless ripoff of kramer vs kramer
 a dysfunctional family requiring introspection and commitment
 kramer vs kramer meets bollywood
 great movie with out english subtitles!
 its about ego conflict
 sensitive and beautiful *possible spoilers*
 for me, this is aamir khan's best
 evergreen movie
