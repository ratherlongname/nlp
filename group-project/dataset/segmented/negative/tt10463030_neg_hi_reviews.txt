 molecule review: bhoot - that haunted ship / tepid horror drama / 2 stars
 unbelievably bad
 utterly boring
 gave 2 because it's always nice to see vicky kaushal on-screen
 typical bollywood horror movie
 pathetic and slow
 poor story
 dissappointed.
 disappointed
 pathetic
 skip it
 tremendous potential but failed execution. please don't make chapter 2 until you get it right
 will there be a part 2?- now that's scary!!
 not at all scary & thrilling quotient is missing too ðŸ˜”
 ordinary
 a rushed second half ruins the experience.
 bad
 a typical bollywood horror movie
 unusual, unrealistic
 plot and concept is good but storyline!
 monotonous tale
 not up to the mark as expected
 failed attempt
 quite pheeka this one!!
 clichÃ©
 sad but true!
 i thought i was watching a horror movie, but i was wrong.
 one time watch
 vicky kaushal saved the haunted ship from sinking at box-office
 a situational horror film with technical brilliance !
