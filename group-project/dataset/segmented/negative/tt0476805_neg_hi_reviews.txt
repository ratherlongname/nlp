 just a knock off of a much better movie
 what a crap, total waste of time.
 wasted time
 its a sad day when priyadarshan has to make a remake and that too a bad one. (of an english movie not his own south movie as he wants us to believe)
 if a dead man wins a lotto ticket, who will the money go to?
