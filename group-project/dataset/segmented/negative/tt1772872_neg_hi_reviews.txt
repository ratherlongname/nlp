 one of the worst films i have ever seen!
 yeah right, we really need 'brains' to watch this masterpiece
 it looks pale, boring and even funny in front of today's tv crime thrillers such as c.s.i.
 bad game... you loose (your money)
 what a bore
 great concept film, poorly executed.
 avoid it
 great plot...poor execution
