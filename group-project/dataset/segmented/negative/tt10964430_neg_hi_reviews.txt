 one sided movie
 extremely boring, slow & unrealistic

 making fun of the real life victims
 so irrelevant
 boring & slow
 moderate movie
 anti-male
 dull and boaring
 overrated feminist melodrama
 average story
 i wasted 2:20 minutes
 top-notch concept let down by bad acting
 just a slap of 14 seconds and just a film of 140 minutes
 bad message for society
 waste
 slapped in overdramatic way
 boring, bad film making. despite the exciting premise.
 what is pro-feminism considered now a days: is being not faithful to her husband is being pro-feminist?
 once again an attempt to encash on human emotions
 overdose of feminism and activism
 short film stuff dragged
 slow movie with poor direction
 good plot but not good directed.
 the target is divorce
 worst message by movie for society.
 being oversensitive
