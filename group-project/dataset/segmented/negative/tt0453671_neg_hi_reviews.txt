 this is why some people hate bollywood
 plot less, silly humor
 yet another senseless piece of junk with no story and not much else
 bollywood - as bad as it gets! shameful
 2 grown men over acting and chasing girls for no apparent reason
 no spice, no sugar
 dean and jerry with both being jerry
 eeeeewwwwwwwwwwwwwwww! what was that!
 worst priyadarshan movie!
 pathetic remake
 don't bother
 the attempt at comedy ruins it
