 you love a food, read it's recipe, cook it , taste it then realize that reading (watching) and (re) making are different things
 full of rubbish and total bs
 i never normally write a review. for this i have to write. this is un-matchable with the original one i.e. chef (2004).
 disappointment!!!!!!!
 same review as my zomatos one
 disappointing!
