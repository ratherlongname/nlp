 and the moral of the story is?
 indian background doesn't suit the story - skip watching this - read story in wikipedia - thats enough
 rape is ok - as long as it's the lower classes
 horrible
 more winter than bottom or is it buttocks?
 disappointing modern adaptation of a classic.
 if it had a different director, it might have been good
