 mind numbing nonsense
 mediocre is an understatement
 there's something wrong with reality...
 good concept, film reeks of americanism
 a wannabe american movie
 aisha, the queen of kitsch
 an average flick...with average performances and below average storyline!!
 rescue impossible: emma cries for help!!
 emma + clueless = aisha
 average...
 waste of time!
