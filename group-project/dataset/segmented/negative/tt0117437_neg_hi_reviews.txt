 a stupid movie i ever seen
 a reminder of the abysmal state of 90's bollywood cinema
 pathetic!
 abusive and definitely a product of its time. leave it in the past where it belongs.
 in my top 10 , my top ten most overrated bollywood movies that is
 best film??? biggest blockbuster?
 first 2 hours are awful, last hour gets more interesting
