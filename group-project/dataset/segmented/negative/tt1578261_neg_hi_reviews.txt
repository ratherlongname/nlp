 lacking in imagination
 absolute misogynistic trash
 the makers should take a break too from giving us such lifeless movies made with a dualistic mindset.
 very unrealistic
 this happens only in india
 pretty but pretty bad as well!!
 good for nothing, waist of time as well as money.
 miserable waste of my time
 story has been done to death...
 quite okay
 another movie with rich looks and poor content
