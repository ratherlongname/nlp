 initial 15 minutes of the movie are reasonably entertaining and probably only believable part of the movie
 absolutely awful
 is this inspiring to indian filmmaking???
 a proof that a bad script will always equal to a bad movie regardless the stardom of the actors
 not worth the time.
 shamitabh:- pure example of how bollywood tries to fool its audience
