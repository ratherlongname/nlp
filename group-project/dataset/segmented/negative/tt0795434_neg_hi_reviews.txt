 nasty and small minded
 the minimum rating is "1" on imdb, i wished to put in a negative value for the same.
 cliché cliché and some more cliché!
 umm... didn't kank already scrape the barrel?
 racist. mysoginistic. narrow-minded.
 an improbable film.
 nonsense unlimited!
 a standard nri film which exploits foreign locations and indian emotions to the hilt
 london praise
 when wil bollywood make character having self respect
 it's a stale biryani !!
