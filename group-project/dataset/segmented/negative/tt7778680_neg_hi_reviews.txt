 another propaganda film
 depressing
 extremely disappointing movie
 waste of time
 boring, waste of time
 utter, absolute torture
 waste of time
 nothing happens. ending is awful.
 actors were like zombies from the walking dead
 open ended story..writer couldn't come up with an ending
 silences and empty gestures doesn't make movies
 waste
