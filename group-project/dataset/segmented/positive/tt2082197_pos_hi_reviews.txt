 most overrated movie of the year
 barfi, sweet, but in parts.
 as sweet as barfi (an indian sweet)
 a movie with a lot of heart

 sweeter then the title
 an innocent tale of love
 thoroughly enjoyable fable, light & bubbly...
 crying and laughing at the same time!
 when the character is central, and not the hero
