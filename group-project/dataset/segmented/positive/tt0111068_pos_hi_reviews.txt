 "ashutosh rana" a spine chilling performer
 based on the silence of lambs
 silence of the lambs
 a criminal love affair
 sangharsh will always be remembered for ashutosh rana's menacing portrayal of lajja shankar pandey
 akshay's over-excitement on prity ruins the seriousness
 an underrated akshay kumar movie.
 a remake of silence of the lambs - bollywood style, which autosh rana saves and makes a must-see.
 best of movie 1999
 excellent ideas..........
