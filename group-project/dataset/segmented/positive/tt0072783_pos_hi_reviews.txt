 pretty funny, though a bit dragged out
 a botanical farce!
 creating cuteness of comedy and love
 a classic comedy
 an eternal indian classic
 hrishikesh mukherjee shows his genius.
 evenly paced fun
 a superb comedy by a superb director performed by superb actors
 something about the characters is magical!
