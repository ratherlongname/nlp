 an above average thriller with all ugly but realistic characters offering quite less than what was being raved about.
 to dark to see
 disheartening, indigestible drama of dirt and squalor
 a raw chronicle of wicked, urban escapades. â™¦ 63%
 watch it, just because it's better than the rest in the market. but not good by kashyap's standards.
 good but not amazing
 redeemed at the end
 great actors, great direction but still some scenes are inspired by korean movie-voice of murderer
