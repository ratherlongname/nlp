 a well made movie but not close to the original story
 mind blowing
 watchable
 gunjan saxena is more important than nepotism and karan johar
 story was good but not with janhvi
 a decent watch but not particularly memorable
 muvi empowering women but defying military values!
 not too overated
 the movie is not that bad like everyone say it is!
 simplistic
 same face in every scene... but pankaj sir was excellent
 average movie
 good movie
 one time watch
 pankaj trivedi - great job
 best biopic
 good movie... could have been better with a better actress playing the lead role
 interesting
 acting not good of actress
 the indian woman rep during kargil war
 quite watchable
 it's a good biopic.
 must watch for pankaj tripathi and for gunjan
 could be a masterpiece....but it is nice though
 i support this movie because it is a good biopic!
 good movie to watch...i am not being bias# nepotism.
 well-made and simple film, jahnvi as gunjan is perfect!
 the biopic was good, the protagonist could have been better
 amazing
 good movie to watch
 underrated!!!!!!
 good
 worth a watch, for sure!
 surprisingly low reviews, movie is 7*
 decent watch
 supporting anti-nepotism does not mean you should not give credit if it due!
 could have been better
 worth watch for at least the concept & storyline...
 amazing
 why so much negativity around this good film?
 good cinematic biography with a lot inspiration
 overwhelming ..and touching
 the kargil girl a nice amazing
 beautiful...
 a good family watch
