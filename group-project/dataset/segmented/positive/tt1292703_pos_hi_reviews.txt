 falls short
 a delightful charming film that has to be welcome in a hindi film industry.
 interesting but more like a docudrama on the life-story of a thief.
 doesnâ€™t make a point, but still a good comic pastime flick!
 good movie
 lucky's character sketch
 another act of defiance
 meet the new-age hindi cinema

 ollo disappoints!!!

 lucky to have this one!
 ignore the critics

 excellent flick
 glad to see something new and so interesting!
 a tacit slapstick with a niche in almost every department of film making
 masterpiece of a movie !!
