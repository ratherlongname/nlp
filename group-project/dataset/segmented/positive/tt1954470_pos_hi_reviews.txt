 epic, badlands kind of film
 guns of wasseypur
 watch it for its execution, performances, music and dialogues but don't expect something fresh in its story content.
 excellent performances marred by poor, repetitive storyline.
 violent & viscous vendetta...
 abundant in expositions and anorexic in turning-points, wasseypur's saga would've worked better as a tv miniseries. on silver-screen, it feels stretched and you feel stressed.
 my anticipation levels were too darn high!
 i wanted to like movie but couldn't
 superb but wont appeal to all
 entertaining documentation with fiction
 gangs of wasseypur(a)---------rating: 3/5 good
 movie ...that could have been a web series
 i think it might be too long
 it is a watchable gang.
 classic
 "here, even a pigeon flies with one wing, and uses the other to guard his innocence."
 kashyap's magnum opus is effortlessly watchable.
