 ungli : too far-fetched
 likable mostly but not totally
 the definition of time pass
 a film on the fight with corruption with new concept & climax.
 better but could have been best
 everyone put your ungli's in the air, f**k a corrupt system!!!
 a welcome take on corrupted india
 a new concept
 in all honesty, i can't give anything less than 10/10 - i couldn't live with myself if i gave anything less for this superb film.
