 simplistic love story, not the kashmir story
 the last green leaf on a dying tree.
 awesome - non historical fact checking movie
 a simple love story, not a movie about conflict. deserves a higher rating
 it's not about hatred but love
 cinema is a fictional depiction of life.
 tad underrated
 humanity wins over revenge
 beautiful art
 people have gone berserk with negative reviews
 highly misunderstood masterpiece
 emotional, brilliant acting!
 decent watch
 full of love
 this movie is not based on j&k riot. it's a story of an lecturer
 proper movie to show the pain of the pandits
 a love story set against the hindu pandits exodus
 it's a poetry
 under rated
