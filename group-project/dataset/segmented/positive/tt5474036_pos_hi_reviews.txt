 great first half but dud second half
 one time watch movie
 nice movie by anurag kashyap
 not a good story
 weird turn of events
 one confusion leaves everyone confused including the audience - disappointing
 love is messy and beautiful
 a different love story
 below expectations!!
 fresh air in bollywood
 deduct 3 star only for not displaying vicky after the interval
 deduct 3 star only for not displaying the vicky's character well in the last

 ending was a disappointment..
 good one..
 surprisingly good
 a confusion better ended earlier
 more of a psychological romance.
 awesome movie..... üòç
 anurag kashyap- a litlle hit and a little miss this time
 love vs companionship
 stays with you long after you walk out of the theatre
 manmarziyan is way ahead of kuch kuch hota hai and hum dil de chuke sanam.
 the people who make jokes of abhishek bacchan's acting, should definitely watch it!
 beautifully told - anurag kashyap makes a different yet charming love story
 relive hum dil de chuke sanam
 reinventing , redefining
 watch for powerful acting of taapsee and vicky but abhishek bachchan steals the show
 this generations hum dil de chuke sanam
