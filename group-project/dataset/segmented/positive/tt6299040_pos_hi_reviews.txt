 had potential, but as usual.. poor execution.
 shouldn't have been copies from crimson tide
 normal movie
 engrossing story with expected ending
 a good indian movie on war.
 a certain dramatic thriller
 builds up good but ends up being over-dramatised. can be considered a one-time watch for the portrayal of an unsung pivotal incident just before the i971 indo-pak war
