 weak writing
 doesnt entertain or titillate but actually educates
 a gripping courtroom drama is judicially correct but sentimentally not..
 abrupt climax, too much english
 the other side of the coin.
 good, but....
 one-line review: section 375 / courtroom drama with some novelty / 7 stars
 "law is a fact. justice is abstract"
 akshaye khanna - i bow down!!!
 good acting
 interesting story; worth a watch; not legally sound; average acting
 alas , only if the movie could have managed to hit a home run.
 great movie but slightly overrated
 good to watch
