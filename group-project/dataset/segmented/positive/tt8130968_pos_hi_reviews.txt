 an interesting remake
 official remake, but doesn't stand out - better watch the original
 well-paced bollywood thriller.
 one time watch.
 an interesting remake but no where near the original
 an indian film with no singing and dancing!
 copied from "the invisible guest"
 adultery is bad
 good but not original
 why?
 found glitches
 not a good copy of the original movie
 copy paste
 a decent edge of the seat thriller.
 this is a complete copy paste
 an ordinary murder mystery
 badla review
 atleast this time they gave it's based on some book (remake of "the invisible guest")
 predictable
 many interesting characters
 one time watch
 copy paste of the original spanish movie
 good
 average but predicatable.
 an interesting film, with a weak ending!
 a good watch for the viewers who do not watch international cinema
 a fine thriller with magic of illusional truth
 interesting, engaging, intriguing and tense ride.
