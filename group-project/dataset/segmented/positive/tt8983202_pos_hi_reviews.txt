 what a movie
 shahid is outstanding, career-best act.....
 typical bollywood movie
 average.... overrated
 karma is not a bi..h . apparently! a discounted version of dev d.
 one man show!
 6/10
 pirated copy of arjun reddy
 shahid kapoor is good, kabir singh not as much.
 intense love story
 end was not good
 didn't get that feel
 the most unique experience:
 nishant
 an mixed movie, which got bad when it reinsposed the regular bollywood customs
 a copy material
 its all about shahid's performance
 good one time watch
 nice movie
 a perfect 8 but a 6 for me
 one-line review: kabir singh (6 stars)
