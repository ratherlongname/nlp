 baar baar dekho has lessons for life but very little to entertain!
 good idea, poor execution
 baar baar dekho is indeed based on great philosophies of life i.e. to live in present, to enjoy the small moments of life, and to have work-life balance.
 entertaining weekend movie - remember, its not a sci fi movie.
 watch it for once !
 decent attempt
 fits in one time watch list
 something out of the box
 brave enough to get the message.
 different from masala bollywood love stories.
 a must one time watch.
 good movie with a strong message
 good indian version of groundhog day..
 loved it...bollywood is definitely reaching hollywood standards..
 well recommended to watch
 a movie for hollywood and anime fans
 a simpler depiction of mr. nobody
 should not been a flop
