 i think the movie is far better than the low overall score that it has received
 cheesy but...
 good movie wrongly rated.
 hrithik's best performance to date
 yaadein deals with the emotion ties between families and the corruption greed can bring into the lives of one's family and friends.
 kareena,hrithik,anu malik save yaadein
 an o.k. movie
 good enough to watch
 a subhash ghai film
 yet another masterstroke by subhash ghai
 the best movie ever but i cant find it anywhere
