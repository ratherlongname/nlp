 a decent flick! shahid is marvelous!
 puts a smile on your face when you leave
 thrice upon a love story!!
 a nutshell review: teri meri kahaani
 the best thing about love stories
 one of the 'freshest' bollywood movies ever made
 unlucky shahid ~ nice movie with bad climax
 brilliant
 simple story but very well handled
