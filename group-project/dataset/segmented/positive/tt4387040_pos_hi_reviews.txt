 a historical achievement enfeebled by poor film-making! airlift is mediocre. period.
 good, not exceptional!
 overrated
 good but could have been much better
 average
 ordinary one time watch patriotic movie
 recalls world's largest rescue mission but failed to create the magic like "argo"
 a film that makes bollwood and india proud
 a good movie 4 an event to remember!
 uplifts indian cinema standard
 airlift is nice, need more movies with this seriousness in bollywood
 just do not miss this one!
 the movie with most positive & least negative comments.
 awesome film though may not be accurate in terms of facts
 very good movie with one big flaw
 movie is well executed & well acted
 akshay's films might not be reaching the infamous 100 crore status, but the man is rightly choosing his subjects becoming the new-age bharat kumar for the present generation.
 good movie but overrated
 common man turning into a hero.... an inspirational film.....
 ordinary film as a movie lover and above ordinary as an indian.
 patriotic...but less perfect as a movie!
 feels like hotel rwanda script merged into real situation
 well executed but faces pace issues
 2016's first good film is here. â™¦ grade b-
 pretty decent but not spectacular !!
 airlift is disappointing
 not so high on patriotism but not so less on entertainment.
 authentic and a simple flick, that focuses only on storyline
 a must watch
 reminds me of hotel rwanda
 yet another fabulous movie from akshay kumar
 raja krishna menon's airlift is a tribute to the human spirits which finds path even amidst turbulence, gears up courage in spite of losing everything.
 hidden truth unfolded with best performance. deserves standing ovation
