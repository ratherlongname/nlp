 a brave script which failed to overtake it's lukewarm screenplay
 an important subject for india, but it's just an 'ok' movie.
 nice subject but had more scope to explore
 pleasantly nice ok feel goodish movie
 missed a golden opportunity
 ek ladki ko dekha toh aisa laga it's strictly a 2.5 film, one star extra for the subject
 an unconventional film
 (lgbti) lovestory,, but thoda slow & boring..!!
 good acting, stupid concept
 excessive stalling of the plot
 good movie !
 good attempt to pass message out of comic drama
 great meal.....insipid dessert
 great message. good rom com
 a brave attempt on an unconventional plot
 eek ladki ko dekha toh aisa laga bit slow paced but a film with heart
 nice movie!
 great thought..but poor story telling
 brave but has its issues
 sends a good message for lgbt community.
 a movie that has a very bold , creative and innovative concept
 much needed for indian audience
