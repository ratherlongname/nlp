 super vfx, but weak story.
 an action pack shake with 1 scoop of sentiments.
 it's just a movie as usual. nothing extra ordinary and artistic.
 a visual theatrical phenomena you cant miss
 2.0 is a brand that could stand tough against the biggest of hollywood franchises.
 an exiquisite movie in indian cinema
 quite upset..
 a visual marvel.
 an average movie with brilliant vfx.
 overrated visual masterpiece
 bad story and screenplay. excellent vfx
 a movie which has brilliant vfx less gripping story no any scientific logic
 one time watch
 only for vfx , bgm and sound effects
 be too positive for 6.8.
 what else is there...apart from vfx
 but......
 focus only vfx (my rating only for vfx and 3d)
 better than 1st part but script is ordinary
 a good attempt but still lackluster.
 its just a 3d treat for eyes...!!
 a movie that could have been hard hitting.
 2.0 delivers what it promises: ultimate vfx banquet
 a good try but a long way to go
 a visual treat
 almost there, but not quite. one time watch.
 sci-fi though fantasy
 cheers to the vfx and 3d effects.but offers no thrills in the story.
 worth for the popcorn
 excellent but script could have been better..
 a disappointing movie
 a visual treat!!
 some where not equaly good drama as action for such a big flim # sankar sir
 best indian sci-fi superhero movie by a big distance
 not better than robot (2010)
