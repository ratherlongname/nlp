 super villain in a fairly good film
 amazing
 a racy cat and mouse chase
 mardaani 2
 spreads a great message .. but full of plot holes to be intriguing ...
 remake of the 1st film itself - copy paste
 let down after mardani 2
 rani was the saving grace!
 mardaani is back but to be honest the villian boy steal the whole show
 dark noir, hard hitting, no nonsense thriller!
 good for single time watch
 villan
 good message
 #freerapeworld
 the only time i've ever preferred a sequel rather than the first film
 a thrilling account of a determined lady cop versus a ruthless rapist
 overall good
 well directed movie with villain performing his best
 not a bad sequel
 it should have dig much deeper into the core issues!
 good but first instalment was better
 this one is a must watch but predictable!
 note it for "mardaani 3"
 mardaani 2 is not so mardaani when compared to mardaani 2014 movie.
 mind blowing villain!
 strong storyline. shallow screenplay.
 dark n grisly crime thriller but a lil letdown by the fourth wall breaking stuff.
 rani mukerji & vishal jethwa show
 mardaani 2 exposes the harsh reality of the current situation with a strong message
 bravura
 good one
 brilliant

 anyone above 18 yrs of age should watch it. be aware, beware...
