 "padman - remake of "phullu" with a list actors"
 great story backed by great performances
 not terrible, but a ridiculous ending.
 this issue must have been addressed so i appreciate it even being over dramatic, slow and preachy at places
 a brave and an inspirational attempt......
 heartfelt & well-acted!
 uxoriousness
 sincere film
 commendable effort but ..........
 educating and entertaining at the same time.
 padman is a refreshing journey which should be lauded for its boldness and message for a cause
 a must watch movie for all
 standard pipeline products
 padman-chaddi ka chamatkar
 story of a man we needed to hear.
 underwhelming
 i enjoyed this movie
 this one deserves to be in imdb 8+ list.
 perfect example to describe the "woman's problem" in india.
 a good film for it's message and execution.
 padman is yet another akshay's entertainer with social message
 this film captured the horrors of being a female in a country full of bhakts very well but
 we can announce confidently - india ke paas apna superhero pad man hai.
 an epic movie....almost!
 brave, inspiring, and bloody good
 "padman"- my review

 emotional, inspirational and engaging biopic
 pad man: r balki's first "period" film with full of social message
