 average
 too many fake or biased 1 star reviews
 only sharad kelkar's part is interesting
 are these real reviews!
 not better than muni 2
 average movie but not as bad as the biased rating it has received
 undeserving of the hate
 a decent remake attempt with a few glitches.
 performance is not necessary , content is
 time pass movie
 full entertainment with a noble message
 laxmii honest review
 decent one!
 shines only in the 2nd half
 deserves more stars than those housefull movies for sure.
 not bad, just an atypical bollywood movie
 movie üçø is good in acting and representation but story ü§¶
