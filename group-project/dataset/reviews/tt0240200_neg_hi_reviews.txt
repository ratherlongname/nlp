 possibly plagiarised script
 water is an insult to all patriotic indians
 copycats
 don't watch this movie
 a very poor movie
 irrelevant movie well-suited for cocktail circuit crowd
 the worst indian film.
 about water
 the statistics stated in 'water' and the message of this movie are questionable!
 stagnant water
 utter garbage...
 another half hearted attempt to beat the past
 watchable...falls short of deepa mehta's skills
