 well attempted thriller with a slow mild first half & a red hot iron second.
 not a bad film...can watch it.
 good and original movie; not that scary, but quite suspenseful.
 not up to my expectations - not a real horror movie
 engrossing thriller
 a concept well utilized
 better than a lot other horror movies
 have patience-till the interval
 good movie. got an issue with it though
 interesting...
 much better than many hollywood productions!
