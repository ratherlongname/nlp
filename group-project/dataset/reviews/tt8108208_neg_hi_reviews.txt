 time wasting & boring
 munde disturbing content
 weak screenplay brings this film down.
 little india directory review: why cheat india (3 stars)
 good concept but totally pathetic
 strong concept with weak music
 movie misses its own subject, leaving us with disappointment and dissatisfaction
 'cheat india' merely robs audiences off their precious time....
