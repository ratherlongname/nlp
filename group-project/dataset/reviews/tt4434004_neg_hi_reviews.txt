 udta punjab is political campaign and conspiracy for vote gain
 what's so "udta" about this movie!!
 disappointed with the uncalled-for cheesy adulteration in my heroine!
 convenient bollywood
 total waste of money
 didn't understand anything
 makers were high while making this film
 i didnt liked the film
 feeble with a whiff of stale air
 not a propaganda or a political film but just a very average one .....
 udta punjab is a mirage
 shahid, alia starrer has flaws, but makes a strong point
