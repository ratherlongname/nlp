 don't trust the low rating
 phantom -- wish the story was true
 indian james bond censored for family audience
 well-made movie, though i have mixed feelings
 don't listen to the low ratings
 i don't agree with you critics....
 a film you wish was true, because india just wants justice. on the lines of a baby and d-day
 an engrossing action-thriller!
 a story you really wished was true
 worth spending 2 hours if not much bothered by ratings.
 best action spy thriller film
 it is a good movie
 cooool
 watchable
 a good effort
 don't believe all the negative reviews
 the message is loud and clear
 in the end scene, she should have emptied the other cup into the sea behind her.
 it"s about pending justice
 phantom-a story you really wish were true!
 feels like an hollywood movie
 a sure blockbuster with wrong casting of protagonist
 proud to be an indian
 the climax gets my rating to 8-else a pretty ok-ok watch
 really good movie ....... must watch
 perfect movie
 a tit for tat of a story
 unfairly slammed
 great
 don't listen bad reviews they all are paid

 low points/bad reviews just because pakistani don't want to see the possible reality
 excellent movie. educational and not typical bollywood romantic movie.
 spreading awareness to curb terrorism
 an action packed thriller way under-praised than what it actually is......
