 one of the best performance by the lead actor
 every turn , action and dialogues is predictable.
 hrithik has found one of his best portrayals yet.
 hrithik saves the movie from boredom
 boring with a few good moments here and there
 not so kaabil, yet worth a watch
 "capable" of entertaining you. â™¦ grade c+
 a good thriller.
 hrithik roshan back in form....
 kaabil - hrithik roshan show all the way.
 with more work on revenge script in the later part of the movie, this could have been a wonderfully made thriller.
 brilliant concept with having emotions and heart at right place
 powerful and thought provoking
 a winner for this hrithik roshan cat and mouse thriller.
 what an enigmatic performance by hrithik !!! makes a great comeback
 not an usual revenge saga
 decent movie to watch
 kaabil full movie review
 kaabil is a pretty good movie and it will not disappoint you.

 kaabil - hrithik's best
 hrithik roshan delivers his career best performance in an otherwise predictable film.
 vengeful and blazingly kaabil hrithik - the underdog hero of an action-drama
