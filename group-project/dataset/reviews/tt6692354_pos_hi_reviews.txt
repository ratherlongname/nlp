 entertaining thriller but no way near to original
 fail to create yash chopra magic
 great beginning and ending
 akshaye khanna entertains in a decent whodunit!
 not enough evidence to support the 2nd half of the film.
 nice movie. but somethings are not realistic
 a well thought out whodunit with a very poorly thought out twist ending.
 surprised. good story
 the coincidence of two murders and a writer
 a remake which retains the flavour of the original
 for me it's average business!
 unnecessary suspense
 strong story with weak dialogues
 a good plot, a matured handling and a brilliant akshaye khanna
 akshaye khanna shines in this unconvincing plot
 not the best thriller yet worthy of a watch !!
 apart crime thriller.
 ittefaq se average
 apart from solid cinematography and editing, ittefaq also benefits from solid performance. akshaye khanna
 one of those films where camera plays a major role rather than just capturing the films
 a rarity in indian cinema!
 average
 preety nice plot
 ittefaq

 they worked so hard on the suspense that they forgot to review the flaws
