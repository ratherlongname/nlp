 lengthy, illogical, but some neat twists and an enjoyable plot. doesn't deserve the hype.
 mediocre by yrf standards. poor lead casting.
 jab tak hai jaan..doesn't take your breath away
 a weak plot beautifully crafted by late yash chopra..
 fairly okay
 an average first half followed by a better second half
 a yash chopra romance....
 clich√©d
 average story with good songs, and good acting by shahrukh
 not a perfect swansong for yash chopra but okay
 for love story lovers
 porridge and commercial. the movie won some laps but couldn't touch the line.
 jab tak hain....khan
 only for those whose heart beats for idealistic love stories.....
 jab tak hai jaan - film of two halves
 an honest review of jab tak hay jaan
 a movie of two acts: unfortunately only one of them is any good
 romance : immortal forever
 a simple yet twisted tale of love followed by great performances
 jab tak hai jaan (review)
 fall in love once again!
 the man who cannot die
 stunned! made me believe once again the true power of love
 my review: yash chopra's last romance!!
 a decent film, could have been better
 good according to bollywood standards
 an exuberant, slightly tart romantic approach from yash chopra
 typical bollywood movie... with a twist
 sincere emotions with illogical occupations.
 jab tak hai jaan is the swan song of yash chopra.
 romantic saga
 "i can't quite put my finger on it"
 an emotional blockbuster
 a beautiful swan song which is slightly out of tune
