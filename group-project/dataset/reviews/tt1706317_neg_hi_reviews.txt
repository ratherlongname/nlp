 one of the worst movie to watch
 predictable, clichéd, boring,
 what a crap........
 what a joke
 wish i could give 0/10
 only watch 'tezz' if your brains are slow...
 thats not a ajay devgan movie !!!!
 with no tezzy at all, it's like a years old wet cracker trying to explode loudly.
 below average
 taking of pelham 123 + unstoppable + a hint of speed, and voilà, you have the recipe for tezz
 below average
