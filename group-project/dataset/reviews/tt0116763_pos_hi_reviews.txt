 awesome debut by slb ....slight flawed at places yet marvellous
 music transcends silence..
 a masterfully made picture that is beautiful, musical, powerful, poignant and heart-breaking/warming
 poignant and heartwarming
 finest movie ever
 the musical silence
 either you turn it off after 20mins, or you fall in love and remember it your whole life
