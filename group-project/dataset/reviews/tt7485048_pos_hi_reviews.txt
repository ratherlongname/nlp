 should've just stuck to the real story.
 highly unrealistic and dramatized work. hichki was better.
 over dramatisation.
 10 stars? are you kidding me ?
 a lot less than i expected
 get rid of the songs.
 inspiring story, bad film.
 super 30 is good but slightly less than super !
 not well made
 an over dramatized, acting based movie
 one-line review: super 30 (6 stars)
 a melodramatic depiction of a famed educator's life
 some scenes r unnecessarily melodramatic
 too!! much masala
 good, if not super 3 hours!
 there is no bigger god than a teacher
 slow and too much of masala
 good start too much filmy bad end
 hrithik inject his terrific performance to make it super-hit
 super 30 is the best movie of this year
 good plot, innovative ideas, feel good movie
 more than movie you will know anand kumar that is an inspiration
 seriously? starting with a hindi speech in front of foreigner peoples??
 okay in script but bad at cinema, only hritik ðŸ‘Œ
 truth be told
 not a brilliant film, but certainly a story that deserves to be told
 motivated
 super performance by h.roshan
 really good
 a simple inspirational story told in the over the top dramatic way.
 could have been better
 a good story, excellent acting with a lame script ruins the party.
 one of the best movie of hr with a very important message .
 hrithik is a good actor- no one can forget this! good movie.
 a motivational movie
 what's up with the songs??
 simple but an important film
 could have been better
 watchable movie on indian education
 earnest but lengthy
 10%truth
 it's good!
 *warning* overhyped, imdb's ratings can be manipulative
 don't listen to the critics.. it's a well made film
 could have been better.....
 a movie with a strong plot
 reaching the unachievable!
 movie has several heartfelt, inspiring moments., it tells a true story but with fiction adeed in last 20mins.
