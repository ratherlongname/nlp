 worst and longest movie of the decade
 a complete waste of time, watch it only if you want to test your patience
 third degree torture
 crap's sweet salute!
 what a disappointment!
 too long and boring.. *plot* stereotype love story
 spend those 4 hours elsewhere
 'never judge a film by it's trailer'
 ...
 six for the price of one
 brain cells lost
 too long and boring
 a tribute to love sans emotion
 love actually
 no good
 bollywood bloat
 a not so fantsatic movie!
