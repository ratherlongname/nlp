 swades is high on hype, low on substance and extremely low on entertainment.
 unbelievable
 poor
 aaaaah, this is pathetic and the people who are praising this movie, just don't have a taste of their own.
 not very good
 the whole is less than the sum of the parts
 clich√©d, fairytale, full of stereotypes
 way too long for the story it tells
 not a documentary
 a massive disappointment
 terrible?
