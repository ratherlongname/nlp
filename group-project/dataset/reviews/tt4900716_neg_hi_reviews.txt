 a highly subjective review
 worst movie
 chutiyapa movie i have seen ever with very bad climax
 horrendous movie
 few comedy scene nothing else
 boring conflicts, uncreative writing
 over dramatic family with clumsy climax
 sidharth brings an attractive vulnerability, fawad doesn't lift off the screen
