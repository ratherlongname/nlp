 great idea goes horribly wrong
 kabhi kisi ko khud se jiyada pyar mat karna or on second thoughts kar lena
 typical bollywood ending
 mediocre story pulled through by good lead and support actors
 biryani with elaichis !! kriti bags it !
 lacks commitment
 entertaining film with a predictable end!!
 a great romantic film with a stupid ending !!!
 something different
 a delightful film with good performances
 should have been rated 6.5
 worth watching
 touching story with a good lovestory
 fresh and yet predictable
 nice
 romantic but routine
 mind refreshing, dramatic scenes. but, here's something that attracts to love it & to forget that drama! believe it or not!
 a very good idea lost in the bollywood format
 a well scripted romantic film !
 an entertaining and endearing romance
 it is very sad to see that nobody can act without rajkumar rao!
 don't go by reviews
 must watch
 a romantic drama with a message
 such a nice and awesome movie
 awesome movie shadi me zaroor aana
 story focuses on the love story of aarti and satyendra who aarti leaves on her marriage day, where satyendra gets his revenge by ranking higher than her
 good movie, don't why there is so much criticism
 beautiful movie backed by powerful performance
 ego vs. love
 only if it was a little smaller
 one time watch

 thukra ke mera pyaar, mera intequam dekhegi !!! watch it for rajkumar rao's acting
