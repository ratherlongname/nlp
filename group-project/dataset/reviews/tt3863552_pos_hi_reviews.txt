 worst film of the year till now
 good attempt
 an emotional comedy-drama and family entertainer, not an action-packed adventure thriller
 a mission set on crossing the borders of two politically conflicting countries and this time for a little girl's love
 good movie.
 a melodramatic effort by touching the cross border propaganda
 avg 1st half; very good 2nd half
 power of humanity
 a highly overrated movie
 this is real salman khan movie
 kabir khan's best work to date
 movie with good sentiments that never looses its plot
 bajrangi will make you a bit better human being......perhaps
 oh yeah, no second thoughts, just go watch it!
 one of the best work of salman khan after "andaz apna apna"
 kabir khan did a great job with creating emotion
 a good movie by salman after very long time.
 a nice film......
 finally a hindi movie with a touching story
 bajrangi bhaijan - a family entertainer which will win your hearts.
 true (tearjerker) bollywood. â™¦ 70%
 nawab bhaijaan
 predictable but distinct among salman khan entertainers
 the story of how a virtuous indian man helps a mute pakistani girl return home after a series of catastrophes occur in her life.
 the proportion of singing and dancing is quite large
 one time watcher
 thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish
 salman and kabir khan's best movie till date
 it feels nice to assume such cinematic liberties becoming true forgetting our ugly past for the benefit of all coming generations. do watch it.
 salman khan's best performance and film to date!
 heart-warming!
 this movie can even make a stone cry..
 salman finally answers his critics.. a movie that makes a casual viewer a fan
 salman's super stardom and well-defined content will make it sustainable at the ticket window and has good legs to prolong its splendid run.
 if you miss this movie, you will regret for sure
 bajrangi bhaijaan endorses the religion of humanity, love and togetherness!
 a love story of humanity
 heart touching and very much enjoyed...
 blockbuster written all over it !!!
 a movie made with love!
 kabir khan has given another flavor of eidi to salman's fan
 winners (just not) take it all.
