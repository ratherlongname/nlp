 a good film missing that powerful punch but nothing close to a masterpiece.
 this kite doesn't soar too high....
 kai po che is a good movie but it just missed the bullseye!
 not as good as the book
 a well-acted film!
 hackneyed. we've seen all of it before.
 brimming niceties, fantastic performances & a scintillating ode to friendship (& its destruction)!
 a good adaptation of the novel.
 sincere attempt
 decent watch but
 bromance+cricket+religion = kai po che!!
 abhishek kapoor's skillful adaptation of chetan bhagat's prosaic novel makes kai po che a rich and engaging experience overall, however the first half is a tad predictable
 must watch for a well told story and great editing
 lovely movie - but biased
 good movie
 kai po che! could have been one of the best hindi movies ever. but...
 quite an entertaining treat you enjoy watching.
 disaaapointed
 sweet but sugar is less
 this one is for sushant
 untitled
 this kite will fly very in the sky
 watch it for the direction, intensity and simplicity! a treat.
 you won't make a mistak !
 a 'good slice of life' type film
 superb adaptation
 made a mediocre book look good
 meticulously crafted crowd-pleaser
