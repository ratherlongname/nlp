 a space drama with a little bit of science.
 a good story..made poor by funny dance and irritating music
 over hype
 typical !
 one time watch
 rocket science dumbed down bollywood style
 a decent enough commercial representation of a real life episode which deserved a great movie.
 indian sentiments
 this mission doesn't fail
 well tried but not super-hit
 you can watch it once
 a joke of mission to mars.
 for isro
 above average
 good but not outstanding
 missed a great opportunity to create a world class film
 if they would have kept it realistic, it could have been worth more watching!
 a spiced up documentary
 wonderful effort
 a poor dramtic version of mars mission
 its good , just good.
 a film that will make every indian feel proud on isro !
 watch it!
 good movie.....
 a must watch movie
 enlightening and humbling 'mangalyaan for dummies'
 space & science movie. explain in simple words.
 nice one
 a terrible music can undoubtedly ruin the sole of a film
 rated as movie not biopic
 could be more intense
 pride on
 mission mangal
 a story made palatable and comics decorated with sustaining interest
 watchable
 you won't step out of theater with disappointment
 off to mars
 akshay kumar again nailed it
 bollywood made it's mark with isro
 a good movie which could have been better.
 great achievement of a nation dramatised so casually
 a wholesome fun popcorn movie
 a movie for science in india. a first for bollywood.
 dont need to read reviews.. just go and watch!
 a must watch movie
 overwhelmingly patriotic!
 great movie & proud moment
 except sonakshi everything is great in this movie.
 this is a theatre experience film. go watch it!
 honest review
 why is everyone criticising.. movies does include drama
 don't know why so many negative reviews?
 one time watch!
 akshay kumar and vidya balan gave perfect upthrust to this cinema.
 follow your passion
 inspiring and entertaining at the same time.
 meaningfull movie
 simply yet entertainingly told an extraordinary story of the result of those 17000 isro scientists' hard work

 such movies need to get commercial acclaim..
