 this kind of absurdity happens when a 'kjo vision' messes with the original thought process of 'ph se phantom'.
 not a movie to watch
 awful movie
 overcooked side of bollywood
 "disaster" if googled, should point here!
 a big time mess!
 the only movie i walked out of
 difficult to digest that it is from director of "queen"
 not 'shaandaar' but 'awful'
 expected better from my $21 ticket
 it's just more than a destination wedding film!
 not worth spending time for..!!
