 unnecessary dramatization of demonitisation
 when he tries he fails.

 wasted time & sleep ðŸ˜´ !!
 waste of time
 could not believe that this director gave us gangs of wassepur
 worst of its kind!
 chaotic and confusing narrative
 don't trust the recent reviews with 10stars
 not a kashyap style movie...
 is this anurag kashyap creation???
 starts well.... then goes to hell
 so boring ......
 dull movie
 paisa nahi bola
 another dud from netflix
 movie resuscitated by saiyami kher
 don't waste your 2 hours of your precious life
 waste of opportunity
 dull filmmaking.
 confused movie
 getting choked by a very insincere effort from a talented director is the only possibility.
 wasted
 whynotgood
 half cooked
 boring dull choking
 expecting better from director! mediocre
 one of the unusual ones from mr. kashyap!
 anurag's modifobia can't make dull show good
 a film that goes no where! avoidable.
