 unnecessarily dragged
 8 mile copy
 8 mile rip off!
 dont believe the rating
 copied from 8 miles
 a wannabe rap film which tries too hard but fails flat. the makers shud be sued for plagiarizing eminem's 8 mile.
 an awful wannabe film loaded with tons of overacting by ranveer. this film is a mishmash of tired clich√©s.

 overrated movie. paid awards.
 they destroyed sushant singh rajput. they target only one religion for their systematic propaganda
