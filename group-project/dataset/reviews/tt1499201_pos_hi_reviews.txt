 a nutshell review: anjaana anjaani
 could have been better, but priyanka chopra takes the film down..
 doesn't live up to the expectations
 from a "non-commercial movies" fan!
 priyanka rocks in this refreshing film
 greatest love stories are between strangers ...very true
 interesting storyline but predictable
 a perfect movie!
 fantastic movie
 awesome
