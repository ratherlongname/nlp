 decent one
 don't really understand the hype
 a bumpy ride.
 messy messy messy
 one tym watch
 nepotism fails again but pankaj and rajkumar acted very well
 a decent film marred with too many characters and a long runtime.
 rajkumar is awesome
 a decent ride.. rajkumar rao stole the show, pankaj tripathi was impressive as ever
 a nonsensical, whimsical, thoroughly entertaining laugh riot!
 ludo leaves with a big smile on our face.
 entertaining, predictable and the story seems forcefully extended
 my favorites
 ludo: it never disappoints
 outstanding mixture
 eliminated tokens (sub-part narration and music) & active tokens (cinematography and humor). this one will still not fail to roll a dye of six (spoiler alert)
 good but feels rather cluttered.
 great characters!
 perfect ludo
 one time watch
