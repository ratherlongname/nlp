 fresh but predictable
 movie with awesome music and full bollywood masala
 the six-day-script is the real king!
 entertaining and intelligently made movie
 friends & company
 badmash company stock rises
 quick rich scheme
 a nutshell review: badmaash company
 watchable, though predictable
 old wine in a new bottle , but still has a fresh look
 chaska rocked
 top film of the year so far...
 best movie of 2010(till now)
 morelikely the best con movie after bluffmaster,
