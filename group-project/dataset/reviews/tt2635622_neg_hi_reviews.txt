 ram gopal verma is a sensationalist not a realistic filmmaker
 no story, sensationalistic acting/direction and over-the-top violence without anything more.
 boring yet non-informative
 it's rather gyan on the attacks of 26/11
 highly irritating !
 i am disappointed by ram gopal varma!
 only reason to watch this movie is to help victims not for story or direction
 incompletely done with serious lack of creativity
