 tension does weaken at times but interesting overall
 raat akeli hai for lockdown time
 started strong but slow pace ruined it.
 knives out inspired
 dispersed focus restrained its true merits!
 not a perfect muder mystery but not boring either
 an okey dokey whodunit
 watchable
 the reveal is indeed a kick in the gut,but the slow screenplay for 75% of the film, doesn't compensate well.
 moderate spaced thriller with some mundane twists
 overrated. rohit shetty cop stuck in an anurag kashyap universe.
 but for nawaz, it's a forgettable movie!
 gripping
