 true story, bad direction
 what a waste of good talent and hard-earned cash!
 terribly made movie!
 bd idea....bad movie
 an unfitting tribute
 good potential but horrible execution
 pathetic attempt to recreate the success of border
 huge disappointment !!!
 warning: you may fall asleep during some of the long drawn songs
 hourly repetition makes this a long movie...*spoilers*
 one hill war?
 india wants pakistan to stay away from kashmir, and you should stay away from this movie also.
