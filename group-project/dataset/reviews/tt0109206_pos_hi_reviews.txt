 diary to scene
 great subject, average as a movie
 excellent, appreciable, and by no means entertaining
 a shocking story, and more so because it's true
 good movie
 "any man that marries a little girl... i'll kill him."
 does anyone realise how controversial this film was?
 no bollywood here!
 fantastic movie but should have been accurate
 full of strong emotion
 excellent
 the hard hitting tale of a murderer messiah
 classic bollywood flick
 not a movie a journey, a lesson
