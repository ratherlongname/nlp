 save your time and money - don't watch this!
 148 minutes of torture.
 worst movie,
 the worst film i have ever seen
 worst movie
 total spoiler
 only look of film is amazing rest is boring
 disappointed
 history, plot fail (facepalm)
 a good attempt that goes overboard and spoils everything
 very rarely do we see a suspense thriller which are as boring as this!
 making fun of a great writer
