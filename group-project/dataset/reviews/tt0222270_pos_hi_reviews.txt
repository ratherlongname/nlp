 nice movie
 indian switching channels
 overall not bad
 prelude to rang de basanti?
 a turning point for the future of hollywood?
 ahead of its time
 still relatable to today's media circus.
 unity is strength
 cool super mega hit of the millennium
 underrated classic
 one of srk-juhi's best!!!
 why wasn't this movie considered a hit? no idea...
