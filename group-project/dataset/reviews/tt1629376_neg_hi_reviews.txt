 pathetic plot for an expected good movie
 pathetic, boring and horrendous
 bhardwaj disappoints!
 a worthless wait for me
 a useless film
 a complete bore
 starts with a bang...ends with a whimper
 vishal bhardwaj's worst
 different type of bollywood nonsense
 no motive of story / loose direction
 7 khoon guilty
 below expectations!
 i can appreciate the attempt but yes, this story was far more predictable than thought of.
 a disappointing film revealing nothing more than its title.
