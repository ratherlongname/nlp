 worst movie ever
 singh saab the craaaaaap
 being a sunny deol fan this film disappointed me.
 boring and unrealistic.
 completely scattered movie
 the 2.5 kg hand is back! â™¦ 33%
 sunny deol with a bit difference but nothing great
 yawn.....pass....
 it offers the same expected revenge & roar but not anything more.
