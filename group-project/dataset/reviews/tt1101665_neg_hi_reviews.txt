 a complete agenda film
 they should not have make it
 full of propoganda against indian army
 weak screenplay, poor dialogues, indifferent performances, and terrible direction.
 only good thing in the movie - kk menon
 pathetic copy of "a few good men" w/ pandering
 kay kay menon and nothing else
 a rip from "a few good men"
 because stereotyping is gallant?
 a hollow remake of a more impressive original
