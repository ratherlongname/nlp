 good concept doesn't always guarantee a good film !
 why bring about a change in urself
 bald and beautiful!
 first half is terrific, second half is unexpectedly bad
 good message, bad film!
 time pass
 one time watch
 bol bala bol
 over-written, under-edited, decently performed - entertaining but exasperating!
 above average.....
 steers clear of stereotyping
 good message but weak climax
 hair or no hair - life is beautiful..!! üëç
 no great expectations please
 good watch
 a good movie experience.
 this is a unique flim
 a good watch with wrong casting
 reality
 one-line review: bala / good entertainer on a hackneyed container / 7 stars
 one time watch , also kinda preachy but ....
 ayushman's one of the best movie.
 bollywood and it's double standards
 same concept but different story compared to ujda chaman
 come fall in love with yourself with bala !
 funny, emotional, good
 typical ayushmann film.
 moral of the movie is love yourself
 decent
 tired of these kinds of movies
 fun family enjoyment with modern well-developed characters
 a one time watch
 brilliant message !
 one of the best films i've seen this year
 this bala is not to be missed
 ayushmann continues to charm the audience with yet another one
