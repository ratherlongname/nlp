 sonam is the worst actress of film industry
 isalam not terrorism
 one of the worst movies i've ever seen!
 bad movie made from good material
 an epic biopic ruined
 great story but very poor acting
 great story but bad direction
 neerja, a story of a hero told by incapable filmmakers
 another mediocre indian movie in the imdb top 250?
