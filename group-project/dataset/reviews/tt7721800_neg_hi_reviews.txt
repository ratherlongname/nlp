 salman is back with a bang!!!!
 overacting characters
 another flop
 salman should really stop being a hero now
 idiotic storyess movie
 disgusting movie
 people here have rated this 10?!
 worst movie ever
 mega disappointing
 why is there no zero no. facility
 mixture of many movies.
 save your money.
 if someone claiming that movie making is like this, i also can make a movie
 waste of time
 for bhai fans only
 this movie is not of this planet
 this film needs to be watched. a masterpiece. bharat is not a film, it's an emotion.
 meaningless movie....
 salman khan dasn't know how to act
 one of the worst movie
 don't waste your time
 repeat stuff
 waste of time and money.

 another poor movie by salman khan
 a very bad remake. very dull.
 pathetic movie, waste of time and money!

 cure to insomnia
 tubelight redux
 empty headed mindless soul less, plot less stupid film
 all these traditional bollywood folks need to check themselves
 bollywood directors need to revise the choices according to their ability while choosing a story moreover a remake
 why?
 all giving above 7 rating are blind fans
