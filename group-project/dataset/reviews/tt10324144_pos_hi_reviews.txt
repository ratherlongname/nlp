 no disrespect!!!
 average
 honest cop meets dishonest system
 good direction, great story
 overrated and boring
 watchable propaganda
 powerful film that raises some important issues related to complex caste system of our country.
 loudest and bravest cinematic shout breaks the silence on cast issues
 amazing historical fiction with great actors
 tried to tell more, than it could!
 nothing new
 very good message by this movie
 anubhav sinha srikes hard.
 beautifully crafted murder mystery
 a review: not just a movie
 a little on the preachy side, but okay.
 the reality is more gruesome
 hard hitting, eye opener!
 good movie
 india today
 bollywood on real story !
 an eye opener to indian society
 good but not the great
 adapted from spanish thriller- 'marshland' with some indian twist!
 great effort
 falls short of expectations
 good narration; beautiful shots among the morning mist; movie title - a misnomer; lead actor - unimpressive
 must watch
 less is more! or less...
 a good film on a very relevant subject
 a very important film!!! but why zee is production partner and credit to yogi adityath???
 thriller and twist
 extra-awesome performance by everyone! must watch movie (prefer this over kabir singh)
 absolutely brilliant with important message
 a realistic movie with positive ending!
 don't miss article 15 at any cost !!! hats off to ayushmann khurrana and anubhav sinha
