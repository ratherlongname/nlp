 roy is a pseudo intellectual, self indulgent film. its nuanced but only a niche audience will enjoy the film.
 my review
 roy - a pretty good film
 two nuanced love stories are better than a quintessential one
 not so bad
 a must watch for people those who really want a break from dumb and shitty movies like bang bang,kick,hny,chennai express,action jackson etc etc...
 i didn't expect that we indian people gave 2.9 rating to this kind of movie.
 not for typical bollywood sh*t lovers.
 worthy art attempt
 roy is a story about a rich and successful writer-director and how love for one girl changed his look on life....
 a good combination of drama with real characters â€“ worth watching.
 you have to watch this movie before judging it.
 it is worth watching at valentine day little boring but one time watch sure
 brilliant movie but too complicated for average viewers
 believe me if write, you will connect to it
 an underrated gem
