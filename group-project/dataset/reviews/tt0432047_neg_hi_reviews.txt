 bad movie..
 a cheap imitation in the dismal ram gopal verma tradition!
 awful!
 sarkar, i am afraid, was a very poor movie.
 rgv is on an active glide-path of self-propelled decline...
 a tribute that falls way short....
 very bad compared to the godfather
 highly disappointing
 sarkar-average ruling
 sarkar not to compared with the role of god father
 only a factory finish
 the left elbow index
