 dishonest!
 pretentious drama, appeal to the exotic, and art may give it some western fans.
 if such a film can win awards, truly film-making is lost
 one word: misled
 dull and pointless.
 a great opportunity missed through the director's over-estimation of his abilities
 an underwhelming "eastern"
