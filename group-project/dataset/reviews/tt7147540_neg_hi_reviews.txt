 everything is bad about this movie
 please bollywood stop with biography movies and film base on true events.
 totally non realistic movie
 ridiculous movie with chichori situations
 unrealistic predictable fairy tale - not recommended
 unravelled slowly
 well directed, average acting, weak storyline
 a snapshot of working class indian family couple around fashion
 not as expected
