 half boring and half enjoyable -a review by myreviews
 the worst movie i ever watched
 most disastrous movie of the year
 a bollywood movie
 a study in stupidity
 neal and nikki (tanisha,uday) spin off
 ignore if u can!
 indemnify me
 rubbish film...
 totally ghisi-piti movie + corny as hell = waste of time.
 avoid these strangers....
 a pointless and very boring movie with uninteresting characters
 it was a documentary! was it?
