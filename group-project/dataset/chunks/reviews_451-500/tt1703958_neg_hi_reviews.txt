 totally worthless movie
 stupidest climax i have ever seen
 waste n copied
 worst romantic film
 worst movie i ever see in theater!
 ek main aur ek tu
 another one with an american complex!
 as plastic as it can get
 could have been a lot better
 an inspired foreign dish served with indian toppings and masalas which ends on a pretty confused note.
 release on 10 february but 9th in dubai
 not enjoyable
