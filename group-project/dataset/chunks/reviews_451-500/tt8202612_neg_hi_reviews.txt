 wahi purana katha
 bad movie
 satyameva jayate is a fairly illogical commercial thriller fronted by two actors who deliver forceful performances.
 a commercial effort to kindle patriotism that fails
 painful throwback to 80's cinema!
 maybe in 80's but definitely not in this millennium.
 your average bollywood movie; lots of unnecessary action and romance
 exaggerated 80s version movie
 complete non-sense
 story is ok but acting is worst
 whats wrong with milap zaveri
 one-line review: satyameva jayate (4 stars)
 gabbar is back meets shahenshah.
