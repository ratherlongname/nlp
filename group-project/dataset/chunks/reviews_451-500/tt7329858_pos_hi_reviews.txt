 wow - didn't see this one coming!
 a welcome movie to bolly of a different horror genre
 well made and creepy.
 a different experience!
 definitely not a fairy tale
 alternate horror flick
 pari misses the opportunity to be an engaging horror film due to incoherent script.
 a good try and a complete risk for anushka.
 a really good debut movie for a director
 ok-ish ... did not live up to hype
 rich in atmospherics & creepiness, despite its uneven story!
 good flick
 definitely worth a watch
 valor attempt to make a good horror movie.
 the soul continues to live - remembering the tortures of previous lives!
 watch it for anushka
 not too horror / good storyline
 pleasantly surprising
 hopelessly romantic (hardly) horror
 fairy, jinn, demon?
 pari is watchable, due to its unique story-line.
 worth watching !
 pari not so scary but definitely a new genre of horror
 supernatural entertainment..
 audience takes time to digest this different cooked dish!
 bold attempt at creating a new genre of horror
 a good attempt by bollywood in horror genre
 pari is a haunting drama which are quite rare in indian cinema with terrific performance from anushka sharma and cinematography...
 its good but not perfect.
 what's all the negativity about? this is a pure piece of art!
 redifining bollywood horror genre
 dark, supernatural, romantic, brilliantly acted and executed
 excellent....different story
