 awful, abysmal, atrocious, appalling film.
 waste of time
 worst thing i've seen in a while
 absurd
 a story of luuuuuuuv
 don't keep your hopes up for this one
 pari - could have skipped it
 the film isn't scary but it will leave you with an unsettled feeling......
 another horror mystery suffers the same fate
 capsule review: pari
 waste of money
