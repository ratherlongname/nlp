 worst movie ever seen, 3d is wasted
 vikram is a funny man
 i give this movie 1 for the humour in it
 utter waste of time
 movie is successful just because it's in 3d
 worst horror movie! don't waste your money and time.
 great turning point in indian horror
 yawn-ted 3d
 this movie is not scary!!
 just made to encash the 3d + horror combination and nothing else.
