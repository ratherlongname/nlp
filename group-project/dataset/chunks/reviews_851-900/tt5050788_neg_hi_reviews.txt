 too much wasted potential...and also that rape scene
 not a great story at all
 he gets raped....how is this okay?!?!?
 lets talk about that r*pe scene
 worst movie ever
 it's not a good movie
 boring!
 awful, pointless
 pointless and irresponsible
 don't waist your time
 satisfies an itch, but...
 miserable film teases with the hope of a plot
 missed opportunity, poorly executed.
