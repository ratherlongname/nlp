 amateurish but could have been better
 slow paced and pointless....
 ambitious, modern, and a little bewildering
 an original movie
 a pleasant, different kind of indian film
 beautifully crafted and honest movie...
 low budget but beautiful
 powerful film
 gorgeous film
 beautiful film!
 honest and beautiful film
 stunning loev story
 an exotic trip and the frustration between friends
 simply beautiful
 this movie has been for sale on dvd for years.
 brave movie for indian market
 ending
