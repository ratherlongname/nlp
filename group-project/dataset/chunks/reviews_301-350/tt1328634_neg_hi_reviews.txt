 overrated
 the greatest movie of all time
 bollywood has taken the "happy ending" too far.
 unmitigated trash!
 another infantile commentary on 'our times' by bollywood...
 why can't they ever improve themselves???
 nice theme but horrible script and crappy dialogs
 very very avg film ..
 i was asked: "if you don't mind me asking, how were you offended by new york?"
