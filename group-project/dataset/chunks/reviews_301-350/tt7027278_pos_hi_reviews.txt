 #kedarnath movie review by #saltedpopcorn
 an enjoyable movie
 give it a watch
 good movie
 decent one time watch with lot of scope for improvement
 strong subject and a good entertaining movie.
 sara ali khan delivers great debut in kedarnath
 worth a watch
 good screenplay
 one time watch for the visuals and sushant singh rajput
 plenty to enjoy, but falls short of greatness
 it is not so bad!
 the only review you have to read for this movie
 awesome movie
 strong visuals and a stellar performance by sara ali khan save this love story.
 amazing movie
 except sara ali khan, everything is watchable
 a decent love story with the disaster as the backdrop.
 very neat acting
 titanic of bollywood!
 clich√©d love story, yet great chemistry
 sara ali khan keeps a sinking boat a float
 don't expect too much
 nice ambiance, nice characters, dodgy ending.
 beautiful
 sweet love spoilt by obsession in religion
