 breathtaking cinematography...excellent performances
 love of the era
 a brave attempt but ultimately bloated and overwrought!
 a slow paced but well directed off beat love saga which may find tough to please one and all.
 failed to meet expectations
 must watch for all lovers of bollywood romances
 bollywood++.
 lootera is a masterpiece of heart wrenching pure romance. a piece of poetry on celluloid. something rare in the bollywood of today
 lootera - second viewing
 lootera is a love story set in india of 1950s.
 our grand parents romance
 slow but fantastic movie
 nostalgic experience of love and lust
 melancholic, but lyrical
 would've thought it was brilliant, if it hadn't come from mr.motwane
 well-crafted but sluggish.
 the last leaf will never fall...
 strong script with good acting!
 lootera - a little slow, a little dark, but sweet & romantic
 a moving painting with a big screen as its canvas.
