 lengthy saga of sikh bravery
 over dramatic.
 technically flawless but somehow lacks the emotional intelligence.......
 a brave tale on big canvas but with so many small holes
 an ok kind of movie
 21 hulks vs an army of ants...so rubbish
 great movie - incorrect kill count
 could have been much better
 very well made movie for full family
 kesari brings the true spirit of 21 sikhs soldiers with honor and respect
 spectacular display of indian valor
 average movie
 a tribute to the brave heroes.
 good movie
 terrific ending
 akshay kumar packs a powerful punch.
 a decent cinematic experience
 jai hind
 a bit impressive actually
 a story in honour of freedom fighters highlighting the sikh community
 history but very cinematic
 good acting, good story, bad directing and cinemagraphy
 pointlessly made into an anti-british film.
 inspiring
 "tried to sell emotion"
