 watch for acting not for subject
 breaking the stereotypes!
 sweet watch
 okay type of movie, interesting concept
 despite konkana and bhumi excelling in their roles, the movie tries to stuff too many lessons into its narrative
 chamakte sitare - yeah right !!
 a chance squandered

 certainly not for current india!

 women in different positions in life gaining confidence, refreshingly portrayed.
