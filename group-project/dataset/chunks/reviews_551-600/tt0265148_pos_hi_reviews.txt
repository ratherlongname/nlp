 enjoy if you have a soft-spot for hrithik
 as usual ,entertaining rajashri movies
 surprisingly cartoonish, but enjoyable
 overacted... but moving, so give it a break!!!
 real treat for the fans of hilarious overacting
 lovely
 best movie in the universe kareena looks like an angel
 a sweet movie made for die-hard romantics
 amateur annoying movie done professionally
