 worst series ever
 worst direction, story, acting,
 tragedy movie
 bad bad and any superlative degree of bad u can think of
 taish goes to trash
 6 pack show !!
 wrong title. should be renamed to trash
 potential becomes a victim of pathetic writing
 ok ok
 not an engaging series !!
 ultra boring show
 boring and boring
 a boring movie
 total trash
 not sure why it's under thriller genre!
 a regular repeated story. nothing new.
 good acting and direction but no content.
