 movie not worth watching
 flawed nonsensical movie
 absolute rubbish
 waste of time
 another bollywood's pathetic adaption from a local news story;sheer waste of up-growing talent.
 the runaway bride
 dolly is an annoying bride. â™¦ 34%
 weirdly fails to exploit its novel con-plot showing the viewers 'baba ji ka thullu' in the end.
 it' not as bad as the critics are saying
