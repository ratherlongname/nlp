 a dark, draggy, moody film-making!
 story of two davids from different eras (tamil)
 very refreshing shots but unfortunately with old plot
 well-made & well-acted!
 its all editing that adds everything to it!
 truck loads of background music & stylized direction makes this movie more than worth a watch!
