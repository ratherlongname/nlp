 the worst movie i have ever seen in my life
 this one probably plays better if you are an indian...
 good acting, catchy title song, great characters, poor screenplay
 not what i expected from the combo of dibakar banerjee and abhay deol
 expected much better from the director of 'khosla ka ghosla'
 the film expects as much of its audience as its audience expects of the film
