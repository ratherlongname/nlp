 a total bollywoodiya movie
 a typical bollywood masala flick
 only a commercial film; expected better!!
 nothing new, but entertaining
 ranveer and rohit teams up for a entertaining filmy drama
 okay okay movie
 singh am entry was awesome!
 fun while it lasts
 very average movie
 shetty's time tested formula at work, again!
 entertaining but could have been better!
 ok movie, but the lead actor ...
 ranveer - the hero!!
 please notice....
 overacting in first half & acting in second half
 a grim social message in the garb of a comedy
 it will tell you something you don't know
 ranveer singh is electrifying and shines through out in this mediocre drama
 jabardast....
 nice movie
 good film
 what is up with all these negative reviews?
 ranveer singh ke liye seeti bajaana! - a sri lankan's review
 faith in rohit shetty movie restored!
 an entertainer with a strong social message
 ranveer rocks
 watch it for ranveer and rohit shetty
 simmba roars enough for a super hit
 my review

 mind blowingly inconsistent (both spoiler , non spoiler review)
