 love and passion, deadly combination
 misjudged and surprisingly unmoving
 inspirational but not sure it needed to be made into a movie
 move over faith & mountains, embrace love & flattened mountains. â™¦ 62%
 nawaaz is shandaar zabardast zindabaad -- but not the movie.
 more of quality, less of entertainment...
 visit a bihar village of 60's sitting where you are!
 a bit of correction
 manjhi - a terrific biopic of a role model, better than shah jahan.
 a well-acted, well-made film!
 nawaz is too good!
 true inspirational story of a poor indian villager who single handedly broke the mountain to take revenge
 i have never gone through such powerful and inspirational real story like manjhi
 it is definitely worth watching thanks to the stupendous performances by nawazuddin siddiqui, superb direction and astounding background score.
 great opportunity thrown away.
 leaves a mark on the viewer.
