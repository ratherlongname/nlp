 tremendous form over substance
 war .. not a war. just a gimmick
 could have been better
 not good enough!
 only for bluff audience
 hrithik is an eye candy
 boring movie
 celebrating the actor
 splendid action but lacks strong plot
 stop thinking that the audience is stupid or not evolved. crap story and equally crap direction!
 fun movie with predictable cliches
 i like the story
 highly improbable
 huge potential but massively underwhelming
 tiger meets lion
 must watch
 leave your brains out to watch
 pointless, senseless and illogical
 watchable...
 watch it for hrithik
 timepass
 a very good action movie
 spectacular visuals and action-packed movie
 power pack action
