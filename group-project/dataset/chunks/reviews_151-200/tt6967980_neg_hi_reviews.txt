 a stale barfi is bad for health. ..
 worst thing my eyes ever witnessed.
 confused character portrayal turns this supposedly pure sweet film into sheer bitterness
 chirag is a selfish bully.
 cliched end
 waste of time
 this movie is promoting delinquency
 if you love a bullying, toxic lead male figure and a wannabe strong female chandelier, this is it
 bareilly ki barfi, honest reviews
