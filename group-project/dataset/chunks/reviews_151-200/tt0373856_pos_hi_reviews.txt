 interesting with a good performance by ajay
 one of the rare good good-cop bad-cop movie
 dark and violent
 political drama
 nice
 a very under rated movie. a must watch if you are a fan of some hard hitting drama
 highlights the essence of democracy!
 best cop movie veer.
 i liked the gangaajal nautanki
 a very real drama revolving around politics, police and public.
 bravest movie of all time
 just awesome!
 gangaajal
 nice film
