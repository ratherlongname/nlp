 great movie
 not bad ....but could have done better ..
 typical karan johar
 emotional roller coaster with more dips than rises...
 could have been better
 some loopholes, but overall a great film, a landmark in bollywood history.
 bollywood with a twist
 good, though could have been better
 a reminder of a classic, filled with wonderful performances. in all a nice entertainer!
 thoroughly melodramatic movie with joy and sorrow, but directional loopholes
 heart touching movie
 a good film!
 can one make a drama that also works as a parody?
 could be better!
 glad to see even the movies with oft repeated storylines are improving by way of focusing on treatment, production values, reduction of melodrama / cliches etc
 fantastic really!
