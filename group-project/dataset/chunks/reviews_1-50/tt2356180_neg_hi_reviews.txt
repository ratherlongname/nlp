 confused screenplay and a drag for 3 hrs
 a bollywood jumble. in fact, a real mess!
 farhan akhtar is anti india
 a motivational movie based on legendary indian athlete, milkha singh's journey
 run run run!
 living in its moments and surrendering in its narration
 bhaag bhaiya bhaag
 could have been a great biopic
 this movie is a lazy attempt at cinema
