 labeled based on a true story but simply fictionalized
 mediocre
 they took the universal sports drama handbook and ran with it
 dangal ...an honest review
 not as great as hyped!
 simple little sports movie
 not happy.
 similar clich√© bollywood movie
 good and worth watching.
 modern story, classic style
 a good film
 feels so bloated and forced that it hampers the, admittedly noteworthy, hearty narrative
 going for gold
 full entertainment, average script, single dimension characters, predictable story-line
 best movie of amir khaan
 not that good
 a movie worth the hype. off the beat, still mainstream. hard-smart work, and it shows.
 sugar coated regressive portrayal of feminine gender
 will power & strong believe to do the impossible can do wonders. truly a work of a legend mr perfectionist you are getting better with each movies !
 incredible sports film
 differs from reality but worth watching
 "you have to fight in a way that people remember you."
 a well-made, well-acted film with a strong message!
 not a must watch, but throughout entertaining
 resurgence of technically sensible movies
 if overrated had a name
 touching and interesting
 classic
 highest grossing indian movies of all-time
 inspiration and women's rights
 the great and the not-so-great point of the film - amir khan
 inspirational
 what a movie
 a great biopic movie but doesn't offers too much new thing
 2 stars minus just for the climax
 aamir's chak de india of 2017 !
 motivational
 energetic,emotional,patriotic and a good message
 2 years later, aamir khan yet again succeeds with this sports-drama. pritam's music is a bronze medal
 another classic from aamir but this time a tribute to mr. phogat
 dangal is sincere in narration, perfect in detailing, true in spirit, patriotic and inspiring at its core.
 with dangal, aamir khan took it to another level of perfection!
 dangal beats expectations!
 in india we celebrate the struggle and not the medals
 great film, but not for the reasons you might think
 gold
 a powder keg of a monster-tainer
 great movie !!, but with some bollywood-ish masala.
 charming, informing and emotional
 a must watch!
 a 2016 masterpiece.
 screenplay and based on true story tag made it good from ordinary story
 a very nice(fictional...i say) bio pic i have ever seen
 an emotional story full of powerful performance.
 hard-hitting and powerful
 perfect movie name for the story
 now this is the perfect example of how casting should be done. not the best of the sports lot by all means, but certainly the way how these type of movies should be made.
 dangal: an inspirational movie
 dangal raises the bar so high!
 entertains and inspires, an epic movie for all ages
