 a bewitching tale of bombay.
 good documentation of beer-bar dancers' lives
 never a story told so frankly! masterpiece!
 a tale of bad girl
 heavy but very good
 chandini bar (a) -------my rating: 4.5/5 stars extraordinary
 life behind closed doors
 quite effective. makes you think of the miseries around...
 blown away by the realism...
 disturbing but powerful
 truly epic
 amazing!
