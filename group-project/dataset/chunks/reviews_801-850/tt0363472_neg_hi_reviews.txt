 a truly ghastly film
 worst film of the year...read my opinion..funny
 terribly made movie
 unfaithful film
 predictable,boring,nothing new and pretty tacky
 why? can somebody please answer me why? i'm begging you!
 bewaffa- another classic ruined by the darshan's
 can we grow up now ??
 why this was made is still mystifying
 idea for the story came from the 90s classic 'hum aapke hain kaun'
 outdated
