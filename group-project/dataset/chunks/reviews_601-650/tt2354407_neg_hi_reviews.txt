 quite dumb
 the inspired concept of a love story happening in 3 different eras simply takes you no-where.
 kunal kohli is hereby awarded the masters degree to ruin a good first half with an anti-climax.
 a golden opportunity gone wasted and mowed by weak script
 a tasteless romance
 innovative but overall falls short
