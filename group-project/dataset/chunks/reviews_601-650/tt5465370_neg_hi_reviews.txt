 starting was good but then story gone awful. finishing disgusting.
 read this before watching
 sonakshi's stunt double for the win
 movie belongs to nineties
 missed the punch.
 poor plot - poor acting
 story itself confused between women empowerment and patience to tolerate oppression.
 sonakshi can't save the film alone...!!!
