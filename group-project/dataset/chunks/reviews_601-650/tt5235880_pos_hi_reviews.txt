 it all makes sense.
 loved it! do watch!
 sincere, fun, educational but doesn't create an impact!
 slapstick sikh superhero
 a good start for another superhero flick!
 this is one good movie!
 a flying jatt is a movie about a normal person who becomes superhero and helps people
 the best movie so far
 much better than ra one or krish
 a bloody masterpiece
 flying jatt 2?
