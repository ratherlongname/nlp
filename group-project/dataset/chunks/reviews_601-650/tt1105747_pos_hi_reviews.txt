 all style but not much substance
 copied rainman
 visually pleasing
 anil kapoor acts great!
 great movie yet quite dull ??
 subhash tried to steal but ended with a heal
 finally ! a decent movie from salman , the drought has ended
 beautiful genre but long
 a worthwhile experience from showman with a blend of family values and love...
 good movie with superb music..
 thoroughly enjoyed this film.
