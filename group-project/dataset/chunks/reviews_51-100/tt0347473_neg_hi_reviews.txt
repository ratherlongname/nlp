 one of the worst movies on indian screen
 a comedy of errors.....what the heck, its not even a comedy!
 this movie really sucks
 a bollywood bollix
 too boring to watch after half an hour.
 a big dissapointment
 lame acting
 ouch ! then what am i doing ?
 main hoon na did not live up to the hype
 uninspiring story but good dancing
 mediocre cinematography
 obviously directed by a choreographer...
