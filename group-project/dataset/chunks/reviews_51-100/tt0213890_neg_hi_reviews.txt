 one of the most disappointing films of the year
 horribly aweful
 romanticism of everything
 bogus bollywood!!!!
 an apology of a movie
 one of the most horrible movie ever made
 a whole lot of loveliness !
 boring...songs are okay though
 just over-acting. ðŸ™„
 too much of love, way too much
 too much love, to the point where it gets funny
