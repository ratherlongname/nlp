 lengthy with unrealistic fight scenes and a very predictable plot typical bhai-movie agonizing 2 point something hours that i'll never get back -
 this movie has some moments
 implausible plot, childish sultan
 sultan - over hyped film with neither substance neither entertainment
 good movie to watch
 i smell tom hardy and warrior (2011)
 salman khan cracks and bleeds in his most real performance
 review
 a one time watch
 movie is above average
 she gave up her dream of olympics - biggest disappointment.
 not a great one but outstanding performance of salman transformed this movie a good one......
 can watch this once if you are looking only for entertainment and no sense
 salman soars in this engaging film!
 film is lengthy, acting is good and plot predictable
 sultan may have highly predictable screenplay but it has its own charm with brilliant performances and scenes.
 mix bag with good performances , nice direction and pretty good fight sequences.
 family sports entertainer
 very inspiring movie specially for any sports person !
 salman's day at work, finally through
 awesome story, star cast and beautiful indian love story....just that i wish aarfa also participated and won the olympics
 a one time watch
 cliche as others!
 finally! best daav from salman khan. applause!!
 bhhaaaaaaiiiiiiii !!!!
 hasn't lived up to the expectations
 an emotional roller-coaster!
 dramatic sports drama with a good punch
 salman khan cracks and bleeds in his most real performance
 sultan, a love story set up in the backdrop of wrestling, inspires us to fight with our inner demons and emerge victorious.
 perfect masala flick
 good wrestling movie
 sultan is in good form
 surprisingly good.
 sultan review: triumph, tears, glory, and brilliant entertainment
 2hrs 50 minutes approx is a bit long.... but it won't disappoint much because of its entertainment factor
 sultan is another bajrangi bhaijaan type performance from salman
 sultan rules over your heart
 give blood
 well done salman
 salmon khan! salmon khan! salmon khan!
 sultan is great but not excellent
 sultan will strike gold at the box office. a perfect amalgamation of drama, emotions, love story with mma / wrestling as a backdrop. an out an out family entertainer.
 salman balboa.
 just another bollywood movie with a superstar
 entertaining sports drama
 great
 sultan (2016)
