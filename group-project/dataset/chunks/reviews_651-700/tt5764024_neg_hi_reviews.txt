 the epidemic of passable movies continue
 overrated
 yawn n yuckkkkkk
 not ok jaanu
 seriously, who's okay with ok jaanu?
 if you missed this movie, you haven't missed anything!!
 a fair totally avoidable...
 as cringy as the title.
 exact copy of a south indian movie
 looks like high-school romance. â™¦ grade d-
 ok jaanu lacks the flow, passion and magic of its original version o kathal kanmani.
 ok jaanu is a terrible remake of ok kanmani and rahman's music is the only pro of this movie.
