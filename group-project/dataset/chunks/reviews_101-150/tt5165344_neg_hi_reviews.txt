 big thumbs down....awful...boring
 a tedious watch
 my money got wasted
 very bad
 doesn't make sense. why would he just leave his wife along amoung his enemies
 this movie is horrible
 poor character of illiana
 distortion of facts. would have worked better if advertised as pure fiction
 ridiculous
 waste of time
 over exaggerated
 just a bit above the boredom
 too many lapses
 save your money, and sit this one out.
 below average!
 one time watch-slow moving
 one time watch
