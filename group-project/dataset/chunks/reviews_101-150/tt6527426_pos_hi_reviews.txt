 okay okay
 awesome and entertaining
 loved this entertainer
 not so. bad......... liked the acting of shahrukh khan.
 anushka and her role spoils the film
 starts in the air and ends up in the pit!!!!!!!
 not exactly zero, may be 5 or 6
 not as bad as some are making it out to be
 zero with substance.
 first half was comdey and second half was boooooring
 srk read the script before you sign a film
 above average
 average movie with a meaningless plot.
 hearty efforts in a messed up screenplay.
 just a feel good film!
 writing this review as a big srk fan
 "zero" disappoints me
 zero has its heart in place...
 good enough for fans..
 stupendous acting but disappointing script !
 zero 2018
 best of srk
 an 8 till intermission, a poor 4 after
 spectacular. forget reviews watch it on ur own then decide it.
 7/10
 zero is magnificent
 a flawed love story
 something new in the indian film industry
 movie is just okay
 experimenting with indian audience
 a film which is great in all aspects
 shahrukh doing what he does best (no major spoilers)
 it is good!
 must watch!!!!!!
 when a "zero" turned out to be a "hero" in the name of love!
 nice movie
 zero is an awkwardly fun film!
 ambitious and flawed with terrific performances
 if u are srk fan,then it's a jackpot
 zero is a good movie, it could have been a great movie. it is worth watching.
 poor script
 one time watch
 a truly magical love story !! srk and anushka weave magic !!
 from meerut to mars
 a good to watch movie
 a brave performance of the actors ruined by a mediocre direction and a bad screenplay
 my rating is based on mother's review. ðŸ˜‚
 confused with the hates
 definitely a movie to watch
 feel good film
 unexpectedly better movie then what's being said
 mind blowing.

 forget critic , decide yourself by watching
 deserves a watch
