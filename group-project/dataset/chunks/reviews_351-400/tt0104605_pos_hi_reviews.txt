 average film
 fantastic masala movie
 abbas-mustan's first hit, akshay's first khiladi movie
 classic !!
 s. khan is not saroj khan
 the best hindi murder mystery of the 90s
 akshay isn't called the khiladi (player) kumar for nothing.
 akki's first decent flick
 a decent whodunit
 good effort for first movie
 super suspense
 khiladi represents everything we liked about bollywood.
 fantastic entertainment....
 perfect thrilled enjoy
 classic khiladi
 movie that gave akshay stardom.
