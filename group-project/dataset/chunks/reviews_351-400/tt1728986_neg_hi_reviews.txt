 don't watch!!
 worst ever rohit shetty film !
 one of the worst movies
 hope this trash from a hit director stops the avoidable trend of remaking the cult classics of hindi cinema.
 waste of time
 rohit shetty's version of the old and classic golmaal with an aneez bazmee climax disappoints.
 skip it please!
