 blown away!!
 bollywood's first attempt of mental comedy turning into psycho thriller
 the surprise need not to be shocking it need to be worthy.
 a fresh take on psychological satire
 pychological thriller
 could have been pathbreaking
 confusing for some
 useless story
 it is kangana's autobiography
 a wicked psycho experiment form indian cinema
 bollywood needs to put more effort to create extra ordinary
 knockout performances
 a good treat, definitely not the best
 a good dark comedy
 a new concept
 a woman with problems. and then some.
 a devilish exploration into two twisted minds that tingles your grey cells but culminates in a predictable finish
 are you being judgemental?
 i would say just okay!
 excellent acting. weak storyline.
 pretentious but not unbearable
 i liked it
 something is wrong in rating system
 funny, quirky, thrilling.
 here's what i think
 movie is insane with shocking elements!!
 it's a good movie!
 something new and solid from hindi
 acting + humor + thrill , a not so perfect blend
 not your typical bollywood movie, but very slow paced.
 great content and attention to detail in this thriller comedy
 @100
 fine screenplay with superb acting
 what's wrong with the ratings
 not for indian mass audience .... not yet
 ticks all the right boxes.
 kaun hai mental?
 crisp, sharp & sophisticated in many terms
 fresh story; message is good
 wow.
 i expected to love it and i did
 new dimension of bollywood.
