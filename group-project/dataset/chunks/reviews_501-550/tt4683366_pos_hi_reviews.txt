 one of the best movies by sunny but not the 90's adrenaline
 good movie but missing old sunny
 not so ghayalistic
 sunny deol still packs a dhai kilo punch!!
 a sunny deol show all the way, a film his fans will relish. a outdated story, with great action sequences. excepted more though.
 ghayal once again is an average movie, don't rush to theaters.
 sunny shines in a so-so fare...
 sunny deol made audience ghayal once again
 ghayal ones again unable to produce a fierce sunny deol
 "ajay mehra" won't disappoint you, worth watching.
 a good movie, could have been better
 once. just once.
 ghayal is back with a bang
 relive the good old "sunny" daysÂ…!!
 slick and thrilling - no nonsense or over drama!
 sunny deol still has that screen presence and charisma....
