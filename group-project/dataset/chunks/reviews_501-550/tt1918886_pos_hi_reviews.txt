 good one time watch!!
 not as bad as everyone is making it look
 better than 100-crore club entries
 good movie
 nice but take it as a movie not real life!!!!!!!
 kids fantasy film sold as something else.
 its worth a watch and enjoyable movie!
 a rare movie that touches upon very relevant underlying theme in today's context
 good family fun, light hearted comedy.
 such great movie !
 imaginatively outlandish
