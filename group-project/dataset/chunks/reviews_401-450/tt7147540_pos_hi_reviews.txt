 despite its minor flaws the movie is an engaging watch..!
 definitely worth the price of the ticket...
 slow , predictable yet entertaining
 it's all good.
 super boring
 one time watch
 neat but predictable movie
 simple, light and good
 not upto the mark.
 lazy writing but good execution
 nice movie. but the ending could have been more entertaining and appealing.
 heart warming simple family drama.
 sui dhaaga was a good attempt spoiled by bad climax
 success story, that wins heart.
 a good movie could have been great
 worth watching the movie
 a decent film.
